Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F 1 of this report. Certain totals may not sum due to rounding. Executive Summary Introduction Biogen Idec is a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, hemophilia and autoimmune disorders. Patients worldwide benefit from our leading multiple sclerosis therapies, and the company generates $5 billion in annual revenues. In the near term, our current and future revenues are dependent upon continued sales of our three principal products, AVONEX, TYSABRI, and RITUXAN. In the longer term, our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products, our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products and assets originating from our research and development efforts, and successful execution of external business development opportunities. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of financial results achieved: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) 2011(1) (2) (4) 2010(3) (4) Total revenues $ 5,048.6 $ 4,716.4 7.0 % Income from operations $ 1,724.7 $ 1,248.9 38.1 % Net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. $ 1,234.4 $ 1,005.3 22.8 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. $ 5.04 $ 3.94 27.9 % (1) Income from operations, as well as net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc. for 2011, was reduced by a charge of $36.8 million to research and development expense incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in October 2011. (2) In the second quarter of 2011 our share of RITUXAN revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately $50.0 million to reflect our share of the approximately $125.0 million compensatory damages and interest that Genentech estimated might be awarded to Hoechst GmbH (Hoechst), in relation to Genentechs ongoing arbitration with Hoechst. (3) Income from operations for 2010 was reduced by approximately $40.0 million related to the achievement of a milestone by Biogen Idec Hemophilia, Inc. (formerly Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and a $205.0 million charge incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with Knopp Neurosciences Inc. (Knopp), which we consolidated as we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of this relationship. The $205.0 million was partially offset by an attribution of $145.0 million to the noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest also includes a charge of $25.0 million related to the payment made in 2010 to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC (Cardiokine) pursuant to the termination of our lixivaptan collaboration. (4) Income from operations, as well as net income attributable to Biogen Idec Inc., for 2011 and 2010, was reduced by $19.0 million and $75.2 million, respectively, resulting from charges associated with our restructuring initiative announced in November 2010. As described below under Results of Operations, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflect the following: Worldwide AVONEX revenues totaled $2,686.6 million for 2011, representing an increase of 6.7% over 2010. Our share of TYSABRI revenues totaled $1,079.5 million for 2011, representing an increase of 19.9% over 2010. 38 Table of Contents Our share of RITUXAN revenues totaled $996.6 million for 2011, representing a decrease of 7.5% from 2010. This decrease was primarily the result of royalty expirations in our rest of world markets, a decrease in selling and development expenses incurred by us and reimbursed by Genentech, which are also included within our total unconsolidated joint business revenues, and our share of a charge recorded by the collaboration in relation to Genentechs ongoing arbitration with Hoechst GmbH. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in our share of U.S. RITUXAN net product revenues which increased 6.0% over 2010. Total cost and expenses decreased 4.1% for 2011 compared to 2010. This decrease was primarily the result of the $245.0 million of IPR&D charges recognized in 2010 as well as a 2.3% decrease in research and development expense and a 74.7% decrease in restructuring charges recognized over 2010. These decreases were offset by a 16.6% increase in cost of sales, a 23.1% increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to TYSABRI revenue growth, as well as a 2.4% increase in selling, general and administrative costs over the same period in 2010. We generated $1,727.7 million of net cash flows from operations for 2011, which were primarily driven by earnings. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $3,107.4 million as of December 31, 2011. In February 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. Under this authorization, in 2011, we repurchased approximately 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $498.0 million. Business Environment We conduct our business primarily within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which are highly competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have already developed products similar to those we are developing or already market. For example, along with us, a number of companies are working to develop or have already developed additional treatments for MS, including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with AVONEX, TYSABRI or both. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates, such as BG 12, may negatively impact future sales of AVONEX, TYSABRI or both. We may also face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence of biosimilars. In the U.S., AVONEX, TYSABRI, and RITUXAN are licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) as biological products. In March 2010, U.S. healthcare reform legislation amended the PHSA to authorize the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve biological products, known as biosimilars or follow on biologics, that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. Global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry. Governments in many international markets in which we operate have announced or have already implemented austerity measures to constrain the overall level of government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming health care coverage and reducing health care costs, and the deterioration of credit and economic conditions, particularly in certain countries in Europe, continue to exert pressure on product pricing, have delayed reimbursement for our products, and have negatively impacted our revenues and results of operations. For additional information about certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read the Risk Factors section of this report. Key Pipeline Developments BG 12 During 2011, we announced positive top line results from our two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, DEFINE and CONFIRM, designed to evaluate the investigational oral compound BG 12 as a monotherapy in relapsing MS. We are preparing regulatory submissions for BG 12 based upon the positive results from these two trials. 39 Table of Contents We acquired BG 12 and FUMADERM (together, Fumapharm Products) as part of our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. We paid $220.0 million upon closing of the transaction and will pay an additional $15.0 million if a Fumapharm Product is approved for MS in the U.S. or E.U. We may also make additional milestone payments to Fumapharm AG based on attainment of certain sales levels of Fumapharm Products, less certain costs as defined in the acquisition agreement. For additional information about these contingent milestone payments, please read the Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contingent Consideration subsection of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FAMPYRA In July 2011, the European Commission (EC) granted a conditional marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in the E.U., which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment. This payment was made to Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Acorda) in the third quarter of 2011. FAMPYRA is an oral compound indicated as a treatment to improve walking ability in adult patients with MS who have walking disability. FAMPYRA was commercially launched in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway and the U.K. in 2011. In 2012, we plan to launch FAMPYRA in Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and other markets. The exact timing of these launches remains subject to our ability to obtain reimbursement approval within the respective markets. We have a license from Acorda to develop and commercialize FAMPYRA in all markets outside the U.S. Under the terms of our collaboration and license agreement, we will pay Acorda tiered royalties based on ex U.S. net sales, and milestones based on new indications and ex U.S. net sales. These milestones, which may total up to $400.0 million, include the $25.0 million payment for successful license of the product in the E.U. The next expected milestone would be $15.0 million, due when ex U.S. net sales reach $100.0 million over a period of four consecutive quarters. For additional information about our collaboration with Acorda, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Long Lasting Recombinant Factors VIII and IX We collaborate with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi) on the commercialization of long lasting recombinant Factors VIII and IX. In 2011, we received opinions from the EMAs Pediatric Committee (PDCO) agreeing to pediatric investigational plans for Factor VIII and Factor IX. In accordance with the PDCOs opinion, we plan to initiate global pediatric trials in previously treated patients less than 12 years of age as soon as sufficient data are available from studies of older patients. The PDCO opinions for Factor VIII and Factor IX are under guidelines published by the EMA for the development of Factor IX and Factor VIII products. Pediatric data from these trials will be required in the initial submission of Marketing Authorization Applications to the European regulatory agency. The Factor IX and Factor VIII hemophilia programs continue to advance according to plan with recruitment of patients in both phase III studies (B LONG and A LONG, respectively). For additional information about our collaboration with Sobi, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In January 2012, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and development agreement with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis) under which both companies will develop and commercialize Isis antisense investigational drug, ISIS SMNRx, for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Under the terms of the agreement, Isis received an upfront payment of $29.0 million and is eligible to receive up to $45.0 million in milestone payments associated with the clinical development of ISIS SMNRx prior to licensing. For additional information about our agreement with Isis, please read Note 27, Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 40 Table of Contents Samsung Biosimilar Agreement In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Samsung BioLogics Co. Ltd. (Samsung) to establish an entity to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar pharmaceuticals. Under the terms of the agreement, Samsung will contribute approximately $255.0 million for an 85 percent stake in the entity and Biogen Idec will contribute approximately $45.0 million for the remaining 15 percent ownership interest. Our investment will initially be limited to this initial contribution as we have no obligation to provide any additional funding; however, we maintain an option to purchase additional stock in the entity in order to increase our ownership percentage up to 49.9 percent. The exercise of this option is within our control. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. For additional information about our agreement with Samsung, please read Note 19, Investment in Variable Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In October 2011, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Portola) under which both companies will develop and commercialize highly selective, novel oral Syk inhibitors for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. For additional information about this transaction, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Results of Operations Revenues Revenues are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Product Revenues: United States $ 1,954.8 $ 1,744.4 $ 1,638.0 12.1 % 6.5 % Rest of world 1,881.3 1,725.7 1,514.9 9.0 % 13.9 % Total product revenues 3,836.1 3,470.1 3,152.9 10.5 % 10.1 % Unconsolidated joint business revenues 996.6 1,077.2 1,094.9 (7.5 )% (1.6 )% Other revenues 215.9 169.1 129.5 27.7 % 30.6 % Total revenues $ 5,048.6 $ 4,716.4 $ 4,377.3 7.0 % 7.7 % Product Revenues Product revenues are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 AVONEX $ 2,686.6 $ 2,518.4 $ 2,322.9 6.7 % 8.4 % TYSABRI 1,079.5 900.2 776.0 19.9 % 16.0 % Other product revenues 70.0 51.5 54.0 35.9 % (4.6 )% Total product revenues $ 3,836.1 $ 3,470.1 $ 3,152.9 10.5 % 10.1 % 41 Table of Contents AVONEX Revenues from AVONEX are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 1,628.3 $ 1,491.6 $ 1,406.2 9.2 % 6.1 % Rest of world 1,058.3 1,026.8 916.7 3.1 % 12.0 % Total AVONEX revenues $ 2,686.6 $ 2,518.4 $ 2,322.9 6.7 % 8.4 % For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in U.S. AVONEX revenues was due to price increases offset by decreased commercial demand. Decreased commercial demand resulted in declines of approximately 3% and 6% in U.S. AVONEX unit sales volume for 2011 and 2010, respectively, from the prior year comparative periods. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in rest of world AVONEX revenues reflects an increase in commercial demand offset by price decreases in some countries. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 6% in rest of world AVONEX unit sales in both 2011 and 2010, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. The increase in rest of world AVONEX revenues for 2011 compared to 2010 also reflects the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates offset by losses recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program. The increase in rest of world AVONEX revenues for 2010 compared to 2009 also reflects gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Losses recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaled $30.6 million in 2011, compared to gains recognized of $35.0 million for 2010 and losses recognized of $39.5 million in 2009. We expect AVONEX to continue facing increased competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world. We and a number of other companies are working to develop or have already commercialized products to treat MS, including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with AVONEX now and in the future. In addition, the continued growth of TYSABRI and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates, such as BG 12, may negatively impact future sales of AVONEX. Increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of AVONEX, as well as increasing price pressure. TYSABRI We collaborate with Elan Pharma International, Ltd (Elan) an affiliate of Elan Corporation, plc, on the development and commercialization of TYSABRI. For additional information about this collaboration, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Revenues from TYSABRI are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 United States $ 326.5 $ 252.8 $ 231.8 29.2 % 9.1 % Rest of world 753.0 647.4 544.2 16.3 % 19.0 % Total TYSABRI revenues $ 1,079.5 $ 900.2 $ 776.0 19.9 % 16.0 % For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in U.S. TYSABRI revenues was due to increased commercial demand and price increases. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 12% and 10% in U.S. TYSABRI unit sales volume for 2011 and, 2010, respectively, 42 Table of Contents over the prior year comparative periods. The increase in U.S. TYSABRI revenues for 2010 compared to 2009, resulting from increased commercial demand and price increases, was offset by the sale to Elan of previously written down TYSABRI inventory which became saleable following the approval of our higher yielding manufacturing process. As our sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin with Elan plus reimbursement for our cost of goods sold, the distribution of this specific inventory reduced our cost of sales, which reduced the price per unit we charged to Elan and reduced our revenues by $7.5 million in 2010 compared to 2009. This inventory was fully utilized during 2010. Net sales of TYSABRI from our collaboration partner, Elan, to third party customers in the U.S. for 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $746.5 million, $593.1 million, and $508.5 million, respectively. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenues reflects an increase in commercial demand offset by price decreases in some countries. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 19% and 23% in rest of world TYSABRI unit sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. The increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenues for 2011 compared to 2010 also reflects the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates offset by the deferral of a portion of our revenues recognized on sales of TYSABRI in Italy made during the fourth quarter of 2011 and losses recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program. The increase in rest of world TYSABRI revenues for 2010 compared to 2009 reflects gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Biogen Idec SRL received a notice from the Italian National Medicines Agency (AIFA) stating that sales of TYSABRI for the period from February 2009 through February 2011 exceeded by EUR 30.7 million a reimbursement limit established pursuant to a Price Determination Resolution (Price Resolution) granted by AIFA in February 2007. In December 2011, we filed an appeal against AIFA seeking a ruling that our interpretation of the Price Resolution is valid and that the position of AIFA is unenforceable. While we believe that we have good and valid grounds for our appeal, an unfavorable decision could negatively impact our results of operations. As a result of this dispute, we deferred $13.8 million of revenue recognized on sales of TYSABRI made in Italy during the fourth quarter of 2011 and expect that we will continue to defer a portion of our revenues on future sales of TYSABRI in Italy until this matter is resolved. For additional information, please read Note 21, Litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. Losses recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaled $6.3 million in 2011, compared to gains recognized of $10.7 million for 2010 and losses recognized of $10.1 million 2009. We expect TYSABRI to continue facing increased competition in the MS marketplace in both the U.S. and rest of world. We and a number of other companies are working to develop or have already commercialized products to treat MS, including oral and other alternative formulations that may compete with TYSABRI now and in the future. The commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates, such as BG 12, also may negatively impact future sales of TYSABRI. Increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of TYSABRI, as well as increasing price pressure. In addition, safety warnings included in the TYSABRI label, such as the risk of PML, and any future safety related label changes, may limit the growth of TYSABRI unit sales. We continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients. Our efforts to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing PML, including through the JCV assay, and other ongoing or future clinical trials involving TYSABRI may have a negative impact on prescribing behavior in at least the short term, which may result in decreased product revenues from sales of TYSABRI. 43 Table of Contents Other Product Revenues Other product revenues are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 FUMADERM $ 54.7 $ 51.2 49.6 6.8 % 3.2 % FAMPYRA 13.6 * * * * Other 1.7 0.3 4.4 466.7 % (93.2 )% Total other product revenues $ 70.0 $ 51.5 $ 54.0 35.9 % (4.6 )% Unconsolidated Joint Business Revenues We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. For additional information related to this collaboration including information regarding the pre tax co promotion profit sharing formula for RITUXAN and its impact on future unconsolidated joint business revenues, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Biogen Idecs share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 872.7 $ 848.0 $ 773.6 2.9 % 9.6 % Reimbursement of our selling and development expenses in the U.S. 6.1 58.3 65.6 (89.5 )% (11.1 )% Revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world 117.8 170.9 255.7 (31.1 )% (33.2 )% Total unconsolidated joint business revenues $ 996.6 $ 1,077.2 $ 1,094.9 (7.5 )% (1.6 )% Biogen Idecs Share of Pre tax Co Promotion Profits in the U.S. The following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S.: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Product revenues, net $ 2,924.5 $ 2,759.2 $ 2,665.5 6.0 % 3.5 % Cost and expenses 730.8 626.8 724.1 16.6 % (13.4 )% Pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 2,193.7 $ 2,132.4 $ 1,941.4 2.9 % 9.8 % Biogen Idecs share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. $ 872.7 $ 848.0 $ 773.6 2.9 % 9.6 % For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in U.S. RITUXAN product revenues was primarily due to price increases and an increase in commercial demand. Increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 4% and 2% in U.S. RITUXAN unit sales volume for 2011 and 44 Table of Contents 2010, respectively, over their prior year comparative periods. The increases for both comparative periods were negatively impacted by increases in reserves established for rebates and allowances related to the U.S. healthcare reform legislation enacted in March 2010. Collaboration cost and expenses for 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, were favorably impacted by Genentech assuming responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts for RITUXAN in the fourth quarter of 2010. The savings realized from the consolidation of the sales force in 2011 were offset by a charge of approximately $125.0 million recorded to the collaboration, representing an estimate of compensatory damages and interest that might be awarded to Hoechst GmbH (Hoechst), in relation to an intermediate decision by the arbitrator in Genentechs ongoing arbitration with Hoechst. As a result of this charge to the collaboration, our share of RITUXAN revenues from unconsolidated joint business was reduced by approximately $50.0 million in the second quarter of 2011. This $50.0 million amount reflects the estimate of the loss that we may incur in the event of a final arbitration award unfavorable to Genentech. The actual amount of our share of any damages may vary from this estimate depending on the nature or amount of any damages awarded to Hoechst, or if the arbitrators final decision is successfully challenged by Genentech. For additional information related to this matter, please read Note 21, Litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. In addition, total collaboration cost and expenses for 2011 was further negatively impacted by a new fee which became payable in 2011 by all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers. This fee is calculated based upon each organizations percentage share of total branded prescription drug sales to qualifying U.S. government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and VA and PHS discount programs). We have reduced our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. by approximately $15.0 million in 2011 based upon our estimate of the fee that will be assessed to Genentech on qualifying sales of RITUXAN in 2011. Under our collaboration agreement, our current pre tax co promotion profit sharing formula, which resets annually, provides for a 40% share of pre tax co promotion profits if co promotion operating profits exceed $50.0 million. For 2011, 2010, and 2009, the 40% threshold was met during the first quarter. Reimbursement of Selling and Development Expense in the U.S. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we and Genentech made an operational decision under which we eliminated our RITUXAN oncology and rheumatology sales force, with Genentech assuming responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts related to RITUXAN. As a result of this change, selling and development expense incurred by us in the U.S. and reimbursed by Genentech decreased for 2011 in comparison to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009. As discussed in Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of pre tax co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenues. Revenue on Sales of RITUXAN in the Rest of World Revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the decline in revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world was due to the expirations of royalties on a country by country basis in certain of our rest of world markets. In addition, revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world for 2010 were favorably impacted by receipt of $21.3 million representing the cumulative underpayment of past royalties owed to us on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world. The royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis. The royalty periods for substantially all of the remaining royalty bearing sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world markets will expire in 2012. As a result of these expirations, we expect royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world to continue to decline in 2012. After 2012, we expect revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world will primarily be limited to our share of pre tax co promotion profits in Canada. 45 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Royalty revenues $ 158.5 $ 137.4 $ 124.4 15.4 % 10.5 % Corporate partner revenues 57.4 31.7 5.1 81.1 % 521.6 % Total other revenues $ 215.9 $ 169.1 $ 129.5 27.7 % 30.6 % Royalty Revenues We receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own. Sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition, manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control. In addition, the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in royalty revenues was primarily the result of an increase in sales of ANGIOMAX, which was licensed to The Medicines Company (TMC). Royalty revenues from the net worldwide sales of ANGIOMAX are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with TMC. The royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year. The increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year. This formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters and, as a result, an adjustment is recorded in the periods in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved. The increase in royalty revenues related to the sale of ANGIOMAX for 2011 compared to 2010 reflects a $14.7 million adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, as net sales levels for 2011 achieved a new royalty tier. Under the terms of our agreement, TMC is obligated to pay us royalties earned, on a country by country basis, until the later of (1) twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of ANGIOMAX in such country or (2) the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent in such country. The annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share. TMC began selling ANGIOMAX in the U.S. in January 2001. The principal U.S. patent that covers ANGIOMAX ( 404 Patent) was due to expire in March 2010 and TMC applied for an extension of the term of this patent. Initially, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected TMCs application because in its view the application was not timely filed. TMC sued the PTO in federal district court seeking to extend the term of the 404 patent to December 2014. On August 3, 2010, the federal district court ordered the PTO to deem the application as timely filed. A generic manufacturer challenged the federal district courts order in an appellate proceeding, but on January 23, 2012 the manufacturer filed a motion to dismiss its appeal. The PTO has granted an interim extension of the patent term until August 23, 2012 pending completion of its review of TMCs application for extension to December 2014. In the event that TMC is unsuccessful in obtaining a patent term extension to December 2014 and third parties sell products comparable to ANGIOMAX, we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to increased competition, which may impact sales and result in lower royalty tiered rates. Corporate Partner Revenues We have also sold or exclusively licensed to third parties rights to certain products previously included within our product line. Supply agreement revenues received based upon those products are recorded as corporate partner revenue. Amounts recorded as corporate partner revenue also include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements. 46 Table of Contents For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing activity. Corporate partner revenues for 2011 also includes a one time cash payment of approximately $11.0 million received in exchange for entering into an asset transfer agreement in March 2011 related to two research and development programs that were discontinued in connection with our November 2010 restructuring initiative. Reserves for Discounts and Allowances Revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, Veterans Administration (VA) and Public Health Service (PHS) discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of international markets in which we operate. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our direct customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, and forecasted customer buying patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we will need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition. Reserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Discounts $ 96.0 $ 77.9 $ 74.0 23.2 % 5.3 % Contractual adjustments 346.4 282.6 192.5 22.6 % 46.8 % Returns 14.8 14.3 16.6 3.5 % (13.9 )% Total allowances $ 457.2 $ 374.8 $ 283.1 22.0 % 32.4 % Gross product revenues $ 4,293.3 $ 3,844.9 $ 3,436.0 11.7 % 11.9 % Percent of gross product revenues 10.6 % 9.7 % 8.2 % Discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term and volume discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases and increased sales. Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates, VA and PHS discounts and other government rebates or applicable allowances. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in contractual adjustments was due to higher reserves for managed care and Medicaid and VA programs principally associated with price increases in the U.S. and an increase in contractual rates as well as an increase in governmental rebates and allowances associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. Product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, return reserves remained relatively unchanged. 47 Table of Contents Cost and Expenses A summary of total cost and expenses is as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 466.8 $ 400.3 $ 382.1 16.6 % 4.8 % Research and development 1,219.6 1,248.6 1,283.1 (2.3 )% (2.7 )% Selling, general and administrative 1,056.1 1,031.5 911.0 2.4 % 13.2 % Collaboration profit sharing 317.8 258.1 215.9 23.1 % 19.5 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets 208.6 208.9 289.8 (0.2 )% (27.9 )% Fair value adjustment of contingent consideration 36.1 ** ** Restructuring charge 19.0 75.2 (74.7 )% ** Acquired in process research and development 245.0 (100.0 )% ** Total cost and expenses $ 3,323.9 $ 3,467.5 $ 3,081.9 (4.1 )% 12.5 % Cost of Sales, Excluding Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets (Cost of Sales) For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of sales, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 466.8 $ 400.3 $ 382.1 16.6 % 4.8 % For 2011 compared to 2010, the increase in cost of sales was driven by higher unit sales volumes, increased contract manufacturing and production costs, and an increase in amounts written down related to excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory. These increases were partially offset by the sale of inventory produced under our high titer production process. Cost of sales for 2011 also includes increased costs associated with AVONEX PEN, the JC virus antibody assay, and sales of FAMPYRA, while cost of sales for 2010 included $6.7 million of period expense related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (RTP). For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher unit sales volumes, increased contract manufacturing activity as well as $6.7 million of period expense incurred related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in RTP. This comparative increase was offset by the sale of previously written down TYSABRI inventory, which became saleable following approval of our new higher yielding manufacturing process. The distribution of this inventory, which was fully utilized during 2010, reduced our cost of sales by $11.4 million compared to 2009. In addition, the sale of inventory produced under our new high titer production process reduced our cost of sales by $8.4 million compared to 2009. We expect an increase in total cost of sales for 2012 compared to 2011, as a result of higher expected sales volumes and increased contract manufacturing activity. Our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. The expiry associated with our inventory is generally between 6 months and 5 years, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant. Amounts written down related to excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales, and totaled $25.4 million, $11.8 million, and $16.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Research and Development For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Research and development $ 1,219.6 $ 1,248.6 $ 1,283.1 (2.3 )% (2.7 )% Research and development expense for 2011 compared to 2010, reflects our efforts to allocate resources within our research and development organization consistent with our restructuring initiative, which is described below under the heading Restructuring Charge, and resulted in a reduction in spending related to certain programs which were terminated or are in the process of being discontinued. These decreases were offset by research and development costs associated with initiatives to grow our business, which include increased clinical trial activity for certain of our late stage product candidates, such as dexpramipexole, Factor VIII, Factor IX, and PEGylated interferon beta 1a. Research and development expense for 2011 compared to 2010, also reflects a reduction in milestone and upfront payments recognized within research and development expense. For 2010 compared to 2009, research and development expense decreased by $34.5 million. This decrease reflects a reduction in milestone and upfront payments recognized within research and development expense and a reduction in spending in certain deprioritized programs offset by increased clinical activity for our daclizumab, PEGylated interferon beta 1a, neublastin, Factor VIII and Factor IX programs as well as efforts to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients treated with TYSABRI. In addition, our costs for the Factor VIII and Factor IX programs increased in 2010 following the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, whereby we assumed full development and manufacturing responsibilities for these programs. We intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. Specifically, we intend to continue to make significant investments in the advancement of BG 12 and our Factor VIII and Factor IX hemophilia programs. We also intend to continue to invest in bringing forward our MS pipeline and in pursuing therapies for other neurodegenerative diseases. We expect total research and development expense in 2012 to be between 24% and 25% of total revenue, and as a result, we expect a modest increase in total research and development expense for 2012 compared to 2011. Milestone and Upfront Payments included in Research and Development Expense Milestone and upfront payments to our collaboration partners, included within research and development expense, totaled $45.9 million, $68.9 million and $151.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in total research and development expense in 2011 is a charge of $36.8 million related to an upfront payment made in connection with our collaboration and license agreement entered into with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Research and development expense for 2010 included the $26.4 million upfront payment made to Knopp Neurosciences, Inc. (Knopp), which became payable to Knopp upon our entering a license agreement for dexpramipexole in August 2010 as well as a $30.0 milestone paid to Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp, formerly Facet Biotech, in May 2010 upon initiation of patient enrollment in a Phase 3 trial of daclizumab in relapsing MS. For 2010 compared to 2009, the decrease in milestone and upfront payments was primarily the result of the $110.0 million upfront payment made to Acorda in 2009. The timing of future upfront fees and milestone payments may cause variability in future research and development expense. Selling, General and Administrative For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,056.1 $ 1,031.5 $ 911.0 2.4 % 13.2 % 49 Table of Contents For 2011 compared to 2010, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to initiatives to grow our business, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI, as well as costs incurred in support of the potential launch of BG 12, offset by a decrease in grant and sponsorship activity and savings realized through our restructuring initiatives, which are described below under the heading Restructuring Charge. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2010 also included incremental charges totaling $18.6 million, which were recognized in relation to the modification of equity based compensation in accordance with the transition agreement entered into with James C. Mullen, who retired as our President and Chief Executive Officer on June 8, 2010. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of AVONEX and TYSABRI, the incremental charges related to the transition agreement with Mr. Mullen discussed above, and increased grant and sponsorship activity. We expect total selling, general and administrative expense in 2012 to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. The expected increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to be incurred in 2012 over 2011 is related to the development of sales force and promotional spending in support of FAMPYRA and the potential launches of BG 12 and our Factor VIII and Factor IX programs. Collaboration Profit Sharing For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Collaboration profit sharing $ 317.8 $ 258.1 $ 215.9 23.1 % 19.5 % For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the increases in collaboration profit sharing expense were due to the continued increase in TYSABRI rest of world sales resulting in higher rest of world net operating profits to be shared with Elan and resulting in growth in the third party royalties Elan paid on behalf of the collaboration. For 2011, 2010, and 2009, our collaboration profit sharing expense included $55.5 million, $45.5 million and $40.0 million related to the reimbursement of third party royalty payments made by Elan. For additional information about this collaboration, please read Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 208.6 $ 208.9 $ 289.8 (0.2 )% (27.9 )% For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, the change in amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily driven by the amount of amortization recorded in relation to our AVONEX core technology asset. Amortization for acquired intangible assets is expected to be in the range of approximately $160.0 million to $200.0 million annually through 2016. AVONEX Core Technology Asset Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our AVONEX product. We refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model, which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the 50 Table of Contents product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenues of AVONEX is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle, and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption model. We believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset. The results of our long range planning cycle completed in the third quarter of 2009, were most significantly impacted by the issuance in the U.S. of the AVONEX 755 Patent in September 2009. As a result of the increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX and the extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset, amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 decreased significantly from those amounts recorded during the first half of 2009. Amortization recorded for the first and second quarters of 2010 was also recorded based upon the results of the 2009 analysis. The results of our analysis completed in the third quarter of 2010 did not result in a significant change in the expected lifetime revenues of AVONEX, and as a result, amortization recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011 were comparable to amounts recorded in the previous four quarters. Our most recent long range planning cycle was completed in the third quarter of 2011, which reflected a further increase in the expected lifetime revenue of AVONEX. This most recent increase in the expected lifetime revenues of AVONEX was primarily attributable to changes in expected impact of competitor products. As a result, amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 decreased from those amounts recorded in the first half of 2011. Based upon this most recent analysis, amortization of our core intangible asset related to AVONEX is expected to be in the range of approximately $100.0 million to $150.0 million annually through 2016. We monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. If there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX determined during our most recent annual review. For example, the occurrence of an adverse event, such as the invalidation of our AVONEX 755 Patent, could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations. Fair Value Adjustment of Contingent Consideration For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Fair value adjustment of contingent consideration $ 36.1 $ $ ** ** The consideration for certain of our acquisitions includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular factor or factors. For acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent consideration payments at its fair value on the acquisition date. We revalue the acquisition related contingent consideration obligation on a recurring basis each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized as a fair value adjustment of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income. In connection with our acquisition of Biogen Idec International Neuroscience GmbH (BIN), formerly Panima Pharmaceuticals AG (Panima), in 2010, we recorded a liability of $81.2 million representing the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration. There was no significant change in the valuation of this liability from the acquisition date through December 31, 2010. The fair value of this contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2011 was $119.1 million. The increase in the fair value of this obligation, of $37.9 million since December 31, 2010, was primarily due to changes in the discount rate and in the probability and expected timing related to the achievement of certain remaining developmental milestones, offset by the payment of a $5.0 million developmental milestone. 51 Table of Contents In addition, we also recorded a contingent consideration obligation of $38.8 million in the third quarter of 2011 related to our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH, our respective sales affiliates in Italy and Switzerland. The fair value of this contingent consideration obligation as of December 31, 2011 was $31.9 million. The decrease in the fair value of this obligation, of $6.9 million since the acquisition date, was primarily due to changes in the discount rate and in the probability and expected timing related to the achievement of certain cumulative sales based and developmental milestones. Restructuring Charge For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Restructuring charge $ 19.0 $ 75.2 $ (74.7 )% ** In November 2010, we announced a number of strategic, operational, and organizational initiatives designed to provide a framework for the future growth of our business and realign our overall structure to become a more efficient and cost effective organization. As part of this initiative: We out licensed or terminated certain research and development programs, including those in oncology and cardiovascular medicine, that are no longer a strategic fit for us. We completed a 13% reduction in workforce spanning our sales, research and development, and administrative functions. We vacated and recognized the sale of the San Diego, California facility as well as consolidated certain of our Massachusetts facilities. For a more detailed description of transactions affecting our facilities, please read Note 11, Property, Plant and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. As a result of these initiatives, we have begun to realize annual operating expense savings of which the substantial majority will be realized within research and development and selling, general and administrative expense. These savings, which are expected to approximate $300.0 million annually, are offset by costs associated with initiatives to grow our business. We have also increased our workforce to support our growth initiatives, including efforts to bring forward our late stage pipeline. Costs associated with our workforce reduction are primarily related to employee severance and benefits. Facility consolidation costs are primarily comprised of charges associated with closing these facilities, related lease obligations and additional depreciation recognized when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the consolidation and closing of related facilities and the discontinuation of certain research and development programs. As of December 31, 2011, substantially all restructuring charges have been incurred and paid. We incurred $19.0 million of these charges during 2011, of which $12.8 million were related to our workforce reduction and $6.2 million related to the consolidation of our facilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we incurred $75.2 million of these charges, of which $67.2 million were related to our workforce reduction and $8.0 million were related to the consolidation of our facilities. The following table summarizes the activity of our restructuring liability: (In millions) WorkforceReduction FacilityConsolidation Total Restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2010 $ 60.6 $ 5.8 $ 66.4 Expense 15.8 2.4 18.2 Payments (81.8 ) (3.9 ) (85.7 ) Adjustments to previous estimates, net (2.9 ) (2.9 ) Other adjustments 8.6 (3.2 ) 5.4 Restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2011 $ 0.3 $ 1.1 $ 1.4 52 Table of Contents Acquired In process Research and Development (IPR&D) For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Acquired in process research and development $ $ 245.0 $ (100.0 )% ** In August 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Knopp for the development, manufacture and commercialization of dexpramipexole, an orally administered small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of ALS. As we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this relationship, we consolidate the results of Knopp and recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $205.0 million upon initial consolidation within our consolidated statements of income for 2010. We attributed approximately $145.0 million of the total IPR&D charge to the noncontrolling interest, representing the noncontrolling interests ownership interest in the equity of Knopp. For additional information related to this transaction, please read Note 19, Investments in Variable Interest Entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. In connection with our acquisition of Biogen Idec Hemophilia Inc., formerly Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Syntonix), in January 2007, we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. One of these milestones was achieved when, in January 2010, we initiated patient enrollment in a registrational trial of Factor IX in hemophilia B. As a result of the achievement of this milestone we paid approximately $40.0 million to the former shareholders of Syntonix, which was reflected as a charge to acquired IPR&D within our consolidated statement of income for 2010. Other Income (Expense), Net Components of other income (expense), net, are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 19.2 $ 22.3 $ 48.5 (13.9 )% (54.0 )% Interest expense (33.0 ) (36.1 ) (35.8 ) (8.6 )% (0.8 )% Impairments on investments (11.5 ) (21.3 ) (10.6 ) (46.0 )% (100.9 )% Foreign exchange gains (losses), net (6.3 ) (3.5 ) 11.4 80.0 % (130.7 )% Gain (loss) on sales of investments, net 17.4 16.3 22.8 6.7 % (28.5 )% Other, net 0.7 3.3 1.0 (78.8 )% 230.0 % Total other income (expense), net $ (13.5 ) $ (19.0 ) $ 37.3 (28.9 )% (151.0 )% Interest Income For 2011 compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest yields on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities offset by an increase in average cash balances. The decrease for 2010 compared to 2009, was also due to lower average cash balances. Interest Expense For 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of capitalized interest. For 2010 compared to 2009, interest expense remained relatively unchanged. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, we capitalized interest costs related to construction in progress totaling approximately $32.6 million, $28.6 million and $28.5 million, respectively, which reduced our interest expense by the same amount. Capitalized interest costs are primarily related to the development of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hiller&oslash;d, Denmark. 53 Table of Contents Impairment on Investments In 2011, we recognized $11.5 million in charges for the impairment of our publicly held strategic investments, investments in venture capital funds and investments in privately held companies. In 2010, we recognized $21.3 million in charges for the other than temporary impairment of our publicly held strategic investments, investments in venture capital funds and investments in privately held companies. The increase over amounts recognized in 2009 was primarily the result of one of our strategic investments, executing an equity offering at a price below our cost basis during the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, we recognized impairment losses of $7.0 million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional $3.6 million in charges for the other than temporary impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities. We may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future. Income Tax Provision For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Effective tax rate on pre tax income 26.0 % 26.9 % 26.7 % (3.3 )% 0.7 % Income tax expense $ 444.5 $ 331.3 $ 355.6 34.2 % (6.8 )% Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions, changes in tax laws, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, acquisitions and licensing transactions. Our effective tax rate for 2011 compared to 2010 decreased primarily due to our 2010 license and collaboration agreement with Knopp, which negatively impacted our 2010 effective tax rate due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of $145.0 million of the associated IPR&D charge. As such, the attributed amount did not generate a tax deduction, causing our tax rate to be unfavorably impacted by 2.8%. In addition, during 2011, we experienced an increase in research and development expenditures eligible for the orphan drug credit, a lower effective state tax rate resulting from a change in state law and the settlement of outstanding matters related to state and federal audits. These favorable items were offset by a higher percentage of our 2011 profits being earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions, principally the U.S., and a non deductible charge for contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Panima. For 2010 compared to 2009, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of $145.0 million of the IPR&D charge related to our license agreement with Knopp. The impact of the Knopp transaction was partially offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in lower rate international jurisdictions in 2010. This change in the location of our relative profits was caused by the growth of our international operations and lower 2010 domestic earnings as a proportion of total consolidated earnings. During 2010, we also experienced a favorable impact on our effective tax rates due to a statutory increase in the U.S. manufacturers tax deduction and an increase in expenditures eligible for our orphan drug credit. In addition, our 2009 effective tax rate was increased by 2.1% as a result of the $110.0 million upfront payment incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with Acorda in the second quarter of 2009. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was also favorably impacted by 2.3% for changes in tax law which became effective during the first quarter of 2009 in certain state jurisdictions in which we operate and the favorable resolution of certain federal, state and foreign tax audits. The resolution of these tax audits resulted in a reduction of our reserves for several uncertain tax positions, which had a favorable impact of 2.1% on our 2009 effective tax rate. 54 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the allocation of our profits amongst jurisdictions, the percentage of our earnings which are subject to taxation in the U.S. and our level of deductible research and development spending. During 2012 we expect our effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. We expect this decrease in rate due to higher clinical trial spending on orphan drug credit eligible programs, including the Phase III studies for Factor VIII, Factor IX and dexpramipexole, and the cessation of certain inter company royalties owed by a foreign affiliate of ours to a U.S. affiliate, on the international sales of one of our products. Noncontrolling Interest For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax $ 32.3 $ (106.7 ) $ 6.9 (130.3 )% (1,646.4 )% On September 6, 2011, we completed the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH, our respective sales affiliates in Italy and Switzerland. Prior to this transaction, our consolidated financial statements reflected 100% of the operations of these joint venture investments and we recorded net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income based on the percentage of ownership interest retained by our joint venture partners. We have continued to consolidate the operations of these entities following our purchase of the noncontrolling interest; however, as of September 6, 2011, we no longer allocate 50% of the earnings of these ventures to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests as Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. For additional information related to this transaction, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. For 2011 compared to 2010, the change in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, primarily resulted from the impact of our Knopp transaction recorded in 2010, offset by the $25.0 million termination payment made to Cardiokine. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax, for 2011 also reflects a reduction in earnings from our foreign joint ventures due to our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments described above, as well as the attribution of a $15.0 million milestone payment to Neurimmune SubOne AG (Neurimmune) upon our submission an Investigational New Drug application for BIIB037 (human anti Amyloid &szlig; mAb) in April 2011, and the attribution of a $10.0 million milestone payment to Knopp upon dosing the first patient in a registrational study for dexpramipexole in March 2011. For 2010 compared to 2009, the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily the result of the attribution of $145.0 million of the $205.0 million IPR&D charge recognized upon consolidation of the Knopp variable interest entity to the noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2010 offset by the $25.0 million payment made to Cardiokine upon the termination of our license agreement and an attribution of earnings from our foreign joint ventures. New Cambridge Leases In July 2011, we executed leases for two office buildings to be built in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a planned occupancy during the second half of 2013. Construction of these facilities began in late 2011. These buildings will serve as the future location of our corporate headquarters and commercial operations. These buildings will also provide additional general and administrative and research and development office space. As a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters and centralize our campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we expect to vacate our Weston, Massachusetts facility upon completion of the new buildings. Based upon our most recent estimates, we expect to incur a charge of approximately $35.0 million upon vacating this facility when the new Cambridge buildings have been completed. This amount represents our remaining Weston lease obligation, net of our estimate of sublease income expected to be recovered. In addition, this 55 Table of Contents decision has also resulted in a change in the expected useful lives of certain leasehold improvements and other assets, which have been shortened due to our anticipated departure from this facility and will result in approximately $25.0 million of additional depreciation that will be realized ratably from the third quarter of 2011 through the date upon which we expect to vacate the Weston facility. Approximately $4.7 million of this additional depreciation was recognized in 2011. Market Risk We conduct business globally. As a result, our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks which may affect our results of operations, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we operate. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. While the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. For example, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currencies decreases, conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the relative amount of such sales in U.S. dollars increases. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of our foreign currency hedging program, which is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Other foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations are recognized in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. In addition, there is speculation that due to the global economic downturn the future of the euro may be uncertain. A significant number of our foreign subsidiaries have the euro as their local currency. In the event that certain countries, such as Greece, abandon the euro the resultant macroeconomic impact remains unknown. An abandonment of the euro, in any or all of the countries in which we operate, could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Our balance sheet exposure to Greece is limited as our only receivables in this market are due from our distributor, which totaled approximately $4.0 million as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we maintain no investment holdings backed by the Greek government. Pricing Pressure Global economic conditions continue to present challenges for our industry. The global economic downturn and the deterioration of credit and economic conditions continue to impact our results of operations, particularly in countries where government sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. Global economic conditions may be further impacted by additional negative economic developments in countries such as France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, whose sovereign debt obligations were recently downgraded and Greece, which is facing possible default of its sovereign debt obligations. As a result, many countries worldwide, particularly those within the European Union, are reducing their public expenditures in an effort to achieve cost savings. Governments in a number of international markets, in which we operate, including Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain have announced or implemented austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs to constrain the overall level of government expenditures. The implementation of measures varies by country and include among other things, mandatory rebates and discounts, price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals. Certain implemented measures have already negatively impacted our revenues throughout 2010 and 2011. We expect to see continued efforts to achieve additional reductions in public expenditures and consequently expect that our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these, similar or more extensive measures are, or continue to be, implemented in these and other 56 Table of Contents countries in which we operate. Based upon our most recent estimates, we expect such measures will reduce our revenues in 2012 by approximately $40.0 to $60.0 million. In addition, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets and limit market growth. The continued implementation of pricing actions throughout Europe may also lead to higher levels of parallel trade. Recent austerity measures that have or are expected to impact our results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following: France: AVONEX reimbursement rates are subject to periodic pricing review. Following a therapeutic class review, revised prices for interferons and glatiramer acetate have recently been published in France. As a result, the price of AVONEX and AVONEX PEN will be reduced by 10% effective April 1, 2012 and October 1, 2012, respectively. We do not expect a change in TYSABRI pricing during 2012. In September 2011, the French government announced that the national target for expenditures in public healthcare has been significantly reduced in an effort to decrease the social security deficit. To achieve this goal, additional austerity measures are being implemented, including an increase in the local pharmaceutical tax from 1.0% to 1.6%. Additional measures to reduce pricing and reimbursement rates and eligibility are expected. Our negotiations to establish the price of FAMPYRA will be subject to such measures. Germany: Effective August 2010, the German government enacted a three year freeze on drug price increases lasting through the end of 2013 and increased the mandatory rebate on drugs not covered by the reference pricing system from 6% to 16%. As a result, sales of AVONEX, TYSABRI, FUMADERM and FAMPYRA have been, and will continue to be, negatively impacted. In addition, the German government further implemented additional legislation in 2011 to manage pricing associated with new drug products introduced to the German market. Under this most recent legislation, drug manufacturers will have one year from the introduction of a new drug to agree pricing with health insurers and requires manufacturers to prove that the new drug product provides some form of added clinical benefit compared to existing drugs or it will be included in a reference pricing scheme. These new drug product pricing regulations may negatively impact revenues on sales of FAMPYRA beginning in the second half of 2012. Italy: In December 2011, the Italian government approved emergency austerity and growth measures aimed at stabilizing and growing the local economy as well as balancing the countrys budget by 2013. Included within these austerity measures are actions to reduce pharmaceutical and healthcare spending which include limiting the reimbursement of prescription drugs; however, most of the cost cutting measures in the austerity package related to pharmaceutical spending are due to be introduced in 2013 and 2014. In addition to these actions, additional measures may be implemented in 2012 which may impact revenues on future sales. Accordingly, the impact on revenues on sales of AVONEX, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA resulting from these expected actions in future periods is uncertain. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2011, Biogen Idec Italia SRL received a notice from the Italian National Medicines Agency (AIFA) stating that sales of TYSABRI for the period from February 2009 through February 2011 exceeded by Euro 30.7 million a reimbursement limit established pursuant to a Price Determination Resolution (Price Resolution) granted by AIFA in February 2007. In December, we filed an appeal against AIFA seeking a ruling that our interpretation of the Price Resolution is valid and that the position of AIFA is unenforceable. While we believe that we have good and valid grounds for our appeal, an unfavorable decision could negatively impact our results of operations. As a result of this dispute, we deferred $13.8 million of revenue recognized on sales of TYSABRI in Italy in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expect that we will continue to defer a portion of our revenues on future sales of TYSABRI in Italy until this matter is resolved. For additional information, please read Note 21, Litigation to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. Spain: Our operations in Spain have been negatively impacted by the implementation of an incremental 7.5% rebate, which became effective in June 2010, on all branded drugs reimbursed under the Spanish National Health System. As a result, sales of AVONEX and TYSABRI have been negatively impacted. 57 Table of Contents Additional discounts could be implemented beginning in mid year 2012, which may negatively affect revenues on sales of our products in Spain in future periods. A periodic pricing review of TYSABRI is also expected in 2012. United Kingdom: AVONEX pricing is subject to the Multiple Sclerosis Risk Sharing Scheme, which aims to ensure that therapies can be purchased at a cost effective price as assessed by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Clinical outcomes from treated patients are entered into a health economic model, which allows monitoring of the cost effectiveness of each of the drugs in the scheme. Actual and expected benefits of the drugs are compared and if there is a significant shortfall in actual compared to expected benefit for a particular product, the price of the product may be reduced. The results of this most recent analysis are expected in the second half of 2012. In addition, while no specific price cuts have been imposed to date in the United Kingdom, measures to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures are also being considered. The implementation of these measures may negatively affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods. Credit Risk We are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S. and Europe with concentrations of credit risk limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. Our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale distributors, public hospitals and other government entities. We monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present challenges. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. Our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant. Within the European Union, our accounts receivable in Italy, Spain, and Portugal continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. The credit and economic conditions within these countries have continued to deteriorate. These conditions have increased, and may continue to increase, the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries. Our accounts receivable exposure to Greece is limited as our only receivables in this market are due from our distributor. Although our contractual payment terms have not changed, over the past year we have noted a lengthening in the time period required to collect accounts receivable balance in certain countries. In countries where we expect to collect receivables greater than one year, at the time of sale, we have discounted our revenues over the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid using our estimate of the countrys borrowing rate. The related receivables are classified at the time of sale as long term assets. Our net accounts receivable balances from product sales in these countries are summarized as follows: As of December 31, 2011 (In millions) CurrentBalance Includedwithin AccountsReceivable, net Non CurrentBalance Includedwithin Investmentsand Other Assets Total Spain $ 68.5 $ 65.5 $ 134.0 Italy $ 19.4 $ 48.7 $ 68.1 Portugal $ 20.6 $ 12.3 $ 32.9 Greece $ 4.0 $ $ 4.0 As of December 31, 2010 (In millions) CurrentBalance Includedwithin AccountsReceivable, net Non CurrentBalance Includedwithin Investmentsand Other Assets Total Spain $ 70.8 $ 29.8 $ 100.6 Italy $ 103.2 $ 14.8 $ 118.0 Portugal $ 17.8 $ 5.5 $ 23.3 Greece $ 3.9 $ $ 3.9 58 Table of Contents Approximately $56.0 million and $45.0 million of the aggregate balances for these countries were overdue more than one year as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Amounts included as a component of investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheets represent amounts that are expected to be collected beyond one year. In connection with our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL, we entered into a credit assignment agreement with Domp&eacute; Farmaceutici SpA. Under the terms of this agreement, Domp&eacute; Farmaceutici SpA purchased all of Biogen Domp&eacute; SRLs outstanding receivables as of June 30, 2011, adjusted for cash received through September 5, 2011, for $104.6 million. We have no retained interests in these receivables and have accounted for this transaction as a sale recognizing a loss of $1.8 million upon their disposition. For additional information related to these transactions, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. As of December 31, 2011, our accounts receivable balances in Italy totaled $68.1 million, all of which resulted from sales of product subsequent to June 30, 2011. In May 2011, European Union finance ministers approved a three year EUR78 billion rescue package for Portugal. Under the terms of the package, Portugal is required to correct its excessive deficit by 2013 and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its health care system, including through austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs. These measures include plans to standardize control procedures to reduce outstanding balances payable to drug suppliers. In December 2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the second review of Portugals progress under the rescue program, noting both that Portugals program remained broadly on track but that a continued deterioration of the economic conditions in Europe remains a serious risk. We will continue to monitor Portugals progress against program targets and assess the collectability of our outstanding receivables within this market. Our concentrations of credit risk related to our accounts receivable from product sales in Greece to date have been limited as our receivables within this market are due from our distributor. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, our accounts receivable balances due from this distributor totaled $4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. These receivables remain current and substantially in compliance with their contractual due dates. However, the majority of the sales by our distributor are to government funded hospitals and as a result our distributor maintains significant outstanding receivables with the government of Greece, which remains in a deep recession. In the event that Greece defaults on its debt and is unable to pay our distributor, we may be unable to collect some or all of our remaining amounts due from the distributor. In addition, the government of Greece may also require pharmaceutical creditors to accept mandatory, retroactive, price deductions in settlement of outstanding receivables and in this event we could be required to repay our distributor a portion of the amounts they have previously remitted to us. To date, we have not been required to repay such amounts to our distributor or take a discount in settlement of any outstanding receivables. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively; however, if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 59 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition is summarized as follows: As of December 31, % Change2011comparedto 2010 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 514.5 $ 759.6 (32.3 )% Marketable securities current 1,176.1 448.1 162.5 % Marketable securities non current 1,416.7 743.1 90.6 % Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,107.3 $ 1,950.8 59.3 % Borrowings: Current portion of notes payable, line of credit, and other financing arrangements $ 3.3 $ 137.2 (97.6 )% Notes payable, line of credit, and other financing arrangements 1,060.8 1,066.4 (0.5 )% Total borrowings $ 1,064.1 $ 1,203.5 (11.6 )% Working Capital: Current assets $ 2,975.4 $ 2,540.4 17.1 % Current liabilities (912.9 ) (1,050.1 ) (13.1 )% Total working capital $ 2,062.5 $ 1,490.3 38.4 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, certain significant cash flows were as follows: $3,697.0 million used for net purchases of marketable securities; $498.0 million used for share repurchases; $314.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements; $332.7 million in total payments for income taxes; $208.0 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $148.3 million of payments made for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH; $104.6 million in proceeds received from Domp&eacute; Farmaceutici SpA for the purchase of Biogen Domp&eacute; SRLs outstanding receivables; $41.3 million in proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments; $36.8 million in upfront payment to Portola under our license agreement dated October 26, 2011 and a $8.2 million investment in the equity of Portola; $25.0 million milestone payment made to Acorda capitalized as an intangible asset. For the year ended December 31, 2010, certain significant cash flows were as follows: $2,077.6 million used for share repurchases; $680.3 million in net proceeds received on sales and maturities of marketable securities; $394.7 million in total payments for income taxes; $183.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements; $173.1 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment; 60 Table of Contents $127.0 million in proceeds, net of transaction costs, received from sale of the San Diego facility; $26.4 million in upfront payments to Knopp under our license agreement dated August 17, 2010 and a $60.0 million investment in the equity of Knopp; $40.0 million payment made to the former shareholders of Syntonix recognized as IPR&D expense; $32.5 million payment made for the acquisition of Panima; $30.0 million milestone payment made to Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp (formerly Facet Biotech Corporation) recognized as research and development expense; and $25.0 million termination payment made to Cardiokine recognized as a distribution to a noncontrolling interest. We have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows earned through our operations. We expect to continue funding our current and planned operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations, as well as our existing cash resources. We believe that existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may, from time to time, also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity. We consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the U.S. Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations or in connection with business development transactions outside of the U.S. In managing our day to day liquidity in the U.S., we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for U.S. federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings. For additional information related to certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read the Risk Factors and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk sections of this report. Preferred Stock In March 2011, the remaining 8,221 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were converted into 493,260 shares of common stock by the holder pursuant to the conversion terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2011, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Share Repurchase Programs In February 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. We expect to use this repurchase program principally to offset common stock issued under our share based compensation plans. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Under this authorization, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $498.0 million during 2011. From January 1, 2012 through January 31, 2012, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $401.5 million under our 2011 stock repurchase authorization. As of January 31, 2012, approximately 10.5 million shares of our common stock remain available for repurchase under this program. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 40.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $2.1 billion under our 2010 and 2009 stock repurchase authorizations. We retired all of these shares as they were acquired. 61 Table of Contents Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Until required for another use in our business, we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments and other interest bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. We mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity, and investment type. For example, we limit our exposure to European sovereign debt securities and maintain no holdings with respect to certain euro zone states, such as Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. The value of our investments, however, may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the credit rating of the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio, and by other factors which may result in declines in the value of the investments. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio if the declines are other than temporary or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity. For a summary of the fair value and valuation methods of our marketable securities please read Note 8, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from December 31, 2010, is primarily due to cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements, and proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments offset by share repurchases, tax payments, purchases of property, plant and equipment, and payments made for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH. Borrowings We have a $360.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which may be used for future working capital and general corporate purposes. The facility terminates in June 2012. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. We have $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due March 1, 2013 and $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 1, 2018 that were originally priced at 99.886% and 99.184% of par, respectively. The discount is amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity. These notes are senior unsecured obligations. In connection with our 2006 distribution agreement with Fumedica, we issued notes totaling 61.4 million Swiss Francs which were payable to Fumedica in varying amounts from June 2008 through June 2018. Our remaining note payable to Fumedica had a present value of 18.6 million Swiss Francs ($19.7 million) and 20.7 million Swiss Franc ($22.0 million) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, balances outstanding under Biogen Domp&eacute; SRLs credit line from us and Domp&eacute; Farmaceutici SpA were repaid in connection with our recent purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investment in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL. For additional information related to this transaction, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to these consolidated financial statements. There have been no other significant changes in our borrowings since December 31, 2010. For a summary of the fair and carrying values of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, please read Note 8, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. Working Capital We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2010, reflects an overall net increase in total current assets of $435.0 million and overall net decrease in total current liabilities of $137.2 million. 62 Table of Contents The increase in total current assets was primarily due to the increase in marketable securities. The reduction in total current liabilities primarily reflects the decrease in taxes payable and the derecognition of the financing arrangement liability upon our recognition of the sale of the San Diego facility on August 31, 2011. For additional information related to the financing arrangement associated with our October 2010 sale and subsequent leaseback of the San Diego facility, please read Note 11, Property, Plant and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. Cash Flows Our net cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years EndedDecember 31, % Change 2011comparedto 2010 2010comparedto 2009 (In millions, except percentages) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 1,727.7 $ 1,624.7 $ 1,074.9 6.3 % 51.1 % Net cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities $ (1,650.3 ) $ 345.3 $ (395.0 ) (577.9 )% 187.4 % Net cash flows used in financing activities $ (319.9 ) $ (1,784.9 ) $ (724.2 ) (82.1 )% 146.5 % Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital. We expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for: Non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and share based compensation charges; Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and Changes associated with the payment of contingent milestones associated with our prior acquisitions of businesses. For 2011 compared to 2010, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in net income primarily resulting from increased product revenues and $104.6 million in proceeds from Domp&eacute; Farmaceutici SpA for the purchase of Biogen Domp&eacute; SRLs outstanding receivables, offset by increased inventory balances and lower liabilities. In addition, during the third quarter of 2011, we reached agreement with the IRS on the timing of the recognition of certain income and expense items. The effect of this agreement is primarily limited to the timing of these items, resulting in lower actual tax payments for 2011 and higher expected payments in subsequent periods. This agreement will have an insignificant effect on our income tax expense for all periods and no effect on our contingencies for uncertain tax positions. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased revenues and lower payments for U.S. federal income taxes offset by an increase in accounts receivable and receivables due from unconsolidated joint business. Investing Activities For 2011 compared to 2010, the decrease in net cash flows provided by investing activities is primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of marketable securities. Net purchases of marketable securities totaled $1,420.3 million in 2011, compared to proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities 63 Table of Contents totaling $680.3 million in 2010. Net cash flows used in investing activities for 2010 also reflect $85.0 million in net payments made to Knopp under our 2010 license and stock purchase agreements. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities, offset by the payments made to Knopp under our license and stock purchase agreements, the $32.5 million payment made upon our acquisition of Panima, our purchases of property, plant and equipment and the milestone payment made to the former shareholders of Syntonix. Net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities in 2010 totaled $680.3 million compared to net purchases of $229.1 million made in 2009. Financing Activities For 2011 compared to 2010, the decrease in net cash flows used in financing activities is due primarily to a decrease in the amounts of our common stock we repurchased and higher proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements in 2011, offset by the $148.3 million of payments made in 2011 for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH. During 2011, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $498.0 million compared to 40.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $2.1 billion in 2010. In addition, we received $314.7 million in 2011 compared to $183.5 million in 2010, related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities during 2011, also includes the repayment of amounts outstanding under Biogen Domp&eacute; SRLs line of credit in connection with our recent purchase of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investment in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL. For 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increases in the amounts of our common stock repurchased compared to the same period in 2009. In 2010, we repurchased 40.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.1 billion compared to 16.0 million shares at a cost of approximately $751.2 million in 2009. Cash used in financing activities also includes the $127.0 in net proceeds from the sale of the San Diego facility, which was accounted for as a financing arrangement until August 2011; and activity under our employee stock plans. We received $183.5 million in 2010 compared to $47.8 million in 2009, related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, excluding amounts related to uncertain tax positions, amounts payable to tax authorities, funding commitments, contingent milestone payments, contingent consideration and our financing arrangements, as described below. Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years After5 Years Non cancellable operating leases (1), (2) $ 675.1 $ 33.9 $ 96.9 $ 93.9 $ 450.4 Notes payable and line of credit (3) 1,284.6 68.1 536.3 81.0 599.2 Purchase and other obligations (4) 79.3 58.4 19.1 1.6 0.2 Defined benefit obligation . 18.6 18.6 Total contractual obligations $ 2,057.6 $ 160.4 $ 652.3 $ 176.5 $ 1,068.4 (1) We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Amounts reflected within the table, detail future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31 for each of the periods presented. (2) Includes future minimum rental commitments related to leases executed for two buildings to be built in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a planned occupancy during the second half of 2013. The leases both have 64 Table of Contents 15 year terms and we have options to extend the term of each lease for two additional five year terms. Future minimum rental commitments under the leases will total approximately $340.0 million over the initial 15 year terms. We are considered the owner, for accounting purposes, of these properties during the construction period. Accordingly, we have recorded an asset and a corresponding obligation totaling $2.2 million, representing the amount of construction cost incurred through December 31, 2011. (3) Notes payable and line of credit includes principal and interest payments. (4) Purchase and other obligations include our obligations of approximately $0.5 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts due in less than one year, approximately $9.2 million related to fixed obligations for the purchase of natural gas and approximately $29.2 million related to obligations for communication services Tax Related Obligations We exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2011, we have approximately $58.4 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. Other Funding Commitments As of December 31, 2011, we have funding commitments of up to approximately $14.5 million as part of our investment in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. As of December 31, 2011, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations (CROs). The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We have recorded accrued expenses of approximately $25.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2011. We have approximately $475.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2011 which are not included in the contractual obligations table above because of our termination rights. Contingent Milestone Payments Based on our development plans as of December 31, 2011, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $1.9 billion as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2011, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. We anticipate that we may pay approximately $40.0 million of milestone payments in 2012, provided various development, regulatory or commercial milestones are achieved. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. These milestones may not be achieved. Contingent Consideration In connection with our purchase of the noncontrolling interests in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH and our acquisitions of Biogen Idec International Neuroscience GmbH, Biogen Idec Hemophilia Inc., and Fumapharm AG, we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. These milestones may not be achieved. We completed our purchase of the noncontrolling interests in our joint venture investments in Biogen Domp&eacute; SRL and Biogen Domp&eacute; Switzerland GmbH in September 2011. The purchase price for the 65 Table of Contents noncontrolling interest included contingent consideration in the form of commercial and regulatory milestones up to $42.5 million in cash. For additional information related to our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture investments, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included within this report We completed our acquisition of Biogen Idec International Neuroscience, GmbH (BIN), formerly Panima Pharmaceuticals, AG, in December 2010. The purchase price for BIN included contingent consideration in the form of developmental milestones up to $395.0 million in cash. For additional information related to our acquisition of BIN, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. In connection with our acquisition of Biogen Idec Hemophilia Inc. (BIH), formerly Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in January 2007, we agreed to pay up to an additional $80.0 million if certain milestone events associated with the development of BIHs lead product, long lasting recombinant Factor IX are achieved. The first $40.0 million contingent payment was achieved in the first quarter of 2010. An additional $20.0 million contingent payment will occur if prior to the tenth anniversary of the closing date, the FDA grants approval of a Biologic License Application for Factor IX. A second $20.0 million contingent payment will occur if prior to the tenth anniversary of the closing date, a marketing authorization is granted by the EMA for Factor IX. For additional information related to our acquisition of BIH, please read Note 2, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. In 2006, we acquired Fumapharm AG. As part of this acquisition we acquired FUMADERM and BG 12 (together, Fumapharm Products). We paid $220.0 million upon closing of the transaction and will pay an additional $15.0 million if a Fumapharm Product is approved for MS in the U.S. or E.U. We may also make the following additional milestone payments to Fumapharm AG based on the attainment of certain sales levels of Fumapharm Products, less certain costs as defined in the acquisition agreement: Cumulative Sales Level Prior 12 Month Sales $500M $1.0B $2.0B $3.0B Each additional$1.0Bup to $20.0B Payment Amount (In millions) &lt; $500 million $ $ $ $ $ $500 million $1.0 billion 22.0 25.0 50.0 50.0 50.0 $1.0 billion $1.5 billion 50.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 $1.5 billion $2.0 billion 150.0 150.0 150.0 $2.0 billion $2.5 billion 200.0 200.0 200.0 $2.5 billion $3.0 billion 250.0 250.0 &gt; $3.0 billion 300.0 These milestone payments are considered contingent consideration and will be accounted for as an increase to goodwill as incurred, in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to business combinations when we acquired Fumapharm. Milestone payments are due within 30 days following the end of the quarter in which the applicable sales level has been reached and are based upon the total sales of Fumapharm Products in the prior twelve month period. Financing Arrangement In July 2011, we executed leases for two office buildings to be built in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a planned occupancy during the second half of 2013. Construction of these facilities began in late 2011. In accordance with accounting guidance applicable to entities involved with the construction of an asset that will be leased when the construction is completed, we are considered the owner, for accounting purposes, of these properties during the construction period. Accordingly, we will record an asset along with a corresponding financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for the amount of total project costs incurred related to the construction in progress for these buildings through completion of the construction period. Upon completion of the buildings, we will assess and determine if the assets and corresponding liabilities should be derecognized. As 66 Table of Contents of December 31, 2011, cost incurred in relation to the construction of these buildings totaled approximately $2.2 million. The future payments related to these leases have been included in the above chart of contractual obligations. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. Legal Matters For a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2011, please read Note 21, Litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant areas involving estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows: Revenue recognition and related allowances; Collaborative relationships; Clinical trial expenses; Consolidation of variable interest entities; Valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination; Valuation of acquired intangible assets, including in process research and development; Inventory; Impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill; Investments, including fair value measures and impairments; Share based compensation; Income taxes; and Contingencies. Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; our price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. Product Revenues Revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. However, sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the sell through model, 67 Table of Contents that is, upon shipment of the product by Elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to Elan. The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings. Reserves for Discounts and Allowances We establish reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid and managed care rebates, Veterans Administration and PHS discounts, product returns and other governmental discounts or applicable allowances associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of international markets in which we operate. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. The estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition. In addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management and distribution services. We have established the fair value of these services and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded that we did not receive a separate identifiable benefit or have sufficient evidence that the fair value did not exist for these services, we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue. Revenues from Unconsolidated Joint Business We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of (1) our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S.; (2) reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the U.S.; and (3) revenue on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world, which consists of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. and Canada by F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. (Roche) and its sublicensees. Pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by Genentech in the U.S. and by Roche in Canada. Pre tax co promotion profits consist of U.S. and Canadian sales of RITUXAN to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third party royalty expenses, and distribution, selling and marketing, and joint development expenses incurred by Genentech, Roche and us. We record our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in Canada and royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Additionally, our share of the pre tax co promotion profits in the U.S. includes estimates made by Genentech and those estimates are subject to change. Actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates. Bad Debt Reserves Bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. Given our historical experience with bad debts, combined with our credit management policies and practices, we do not presently maintain significant bad debt reserves. However certain of our customers are based in countries where the economic conditions continue to present challenges. We continue to monitor these conditions and associated impacts on the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. Our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not exceeded managements estimates. Concentrations of Credit Risk The majority of our receivables arise from product sales in the United States and Europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors, large pharmaceutical companies, public hospitals and other government entities. We monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business, especially in light of the global economic downturn. The credit and economic conditions within many of the international markets in which we operate, particularly in certain countries throughout Europe, such 68 Table of Contents as Italy, Spain and Portugal, have continued to deteriorate throughout 2011. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. If economic conditions worsen and or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate, our risk of collectability may increase, which may result in additional allowances and or significant bad debts. For additional information about related to our concentration of credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances, please read the subsection above entitled Credit Risk in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report. Royalty Revenues We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights. The license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products. There are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements. We record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period. The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known, typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees. To the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues, we record such revenues on a cash basis. Collaborative Relationships We evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity. Amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense, except as discussed in Note 20, Collaborations to our consolidated financial statements. As discussed within Note 20, Genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for RITUXAN. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the development of RITUXAN are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of pre tax co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue. For collaborations with commercialized products, if we are the principal, we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income. If we are not the principal, we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue. Clinical Trial Expenses Clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CROs to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities We consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. For such consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than 100% of the economics, we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider a number of factors, including our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entitys economic success, 69 Table of Contents our contractual rights and responsibilities under the arrangement and the significance of the arrangement to each party. These considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative and joint venture relationships and may result in the future consolidation of companies or entities with which we have collaborative or other arrangements. Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination For acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones, or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period. Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets, including In process Research and Development We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process research and development product candidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects; projecting regulatory approvals; estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. We believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the IPR&D analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. Prior to January 1, 2009, we measured acquired IPR&D in a business combination at fair value and expensed it on acquisition date if that technology lacked an alternative future use, or capitalized it as an intangible asset if certain criteria were met; however, effective January 1, 2009, if we are purchasing a business, the acquired IPR&D is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually until commercialization, after which time the IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life. If we acquire an asset or group of assets, that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting 70 Table of Contents standards; then the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to expense as they are incurred if the technology lacks alternative future uses. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined in a manner that approximates the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products, which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed. Capitalization of Inventory Costs Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on managements judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval. There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods. Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. Impairment and Amortization of Long lived Assets and Accounting for Goodwill Long lived Assets Other than Goodwill Long lived assets to be held and used, including property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. 71 Table of Contents Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our AVONEX product. We believe the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our AVONEX product, which we refer to as the economic consumption amortization model. This amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset. An analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle, and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model. This analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis, such as the anticipated product sales of AVONEX and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates, as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents. Although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset, the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances, due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise. We completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of 2011. Based upon this analysis, amortization of our core intangible asset related to AVONEX is expected to be in the range of $100.0 million to $150.0 million annually through 2016. We monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. If there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of AVONEX determined during our most recent annual review. For example, the occurrence of an adverse event, such as the invalidation of our AVONEX 755 Patent, could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations. We did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Goodwill Goodwill totaled approximately $1,146.3 million as of December 31, 2011, and relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. We assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. The provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of our reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference. In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This newly issued accounting standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step impairment test. This ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for Biogen Idec means January 1, 2012. Early adoption is permitted; however, we have not elected to do so. For additional information related to this new accounting standard, please read the section entitled New Accounting Pronouncements within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included within this report. We completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009 and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. In each year, the fair value of our reporting unit, which includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit. 72 Table of Contents Investments, including Fair Value Measures and Impairments We invest in various types of securities, including short term and long term marketable securities, principally corporate notes, government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities, in which our excess cash balances are invested. In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset. As noted in Note 8, Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, a majority of our financial assets have been classified as Level 2. These assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services. The pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value, including reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. We validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets. We also have some investments classified as Level 3 whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies. We apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties. While we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations. Impairment We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income. For available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss. Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss. Share Based Compensation We make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense associated with awards made under our share based compensation arrangements. Changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share based payments. Determining the appropriate valuation model and related assumptions requires judgment, and includes estimating the expected market price of our stock on vesting date and stock price volatility as well as the term of the expected awards. Determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. The 73 Table of Contents estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the performance as appropriate. The cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change. We also estimate forfeitures over the requisite service period when recognizing share based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors; these estimates are adjusted to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from our estimates. Income Taxes We prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdictions tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include, among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2011, our non U.S. subsidiaries undistributed foreign earnings included in consolidated retained earnings and other basis differences aggregated approximately $2.7 billion. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the U.S.; however, if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs, the resultant tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations. The residual U.S. tax liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be approximately $600 million to $700 million as of December 31, 2011. Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional 74 Table of Contents information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Standards For a discussion of new accounting standards please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have operations or maintain distribution relationships in the U.S., Europe, Middle East, Canada, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, India and elsewhere in Asia in connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI and in Germany in connection with the sale of FUMADERM. We also launched FAMPYRA in Australia and certain European countries during the second half of 2011. In addition, we receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN in the rest of world. As a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Danish krone, Swedish krona, British pound, and Japanese yen. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. The majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical adverse 10% movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $79.6 million and $65.5 million, respectively. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions. In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $17.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The returns from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change. A 100 basis point adverse movement (decrease) in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately $14.8 million and $11.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
