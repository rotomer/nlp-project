MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking Statements This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRocks future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations.

BlackRock cautions that forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. In addition to factors previously disclosed in BlackRocks SEC reports and those identified elsewhere in this report, including the Risk Factors section of Item 1A. of this report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management; (3) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRocks investment products, including its separately managed accounts and the former MLIM Business: (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of capital improvement projects; (6) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (7) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (8) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (9) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; (10) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock, Merrill Lynch or PNC; (11) terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries, and BlackRock; (12) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (13) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the value of advisory fees earned by BlackRock and certain investments denominated in foreign currencies; (14) the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (15) BlackRocks ability to successfully integrate the MLIM Business with its existing business; (16) the ability of BlackRock to effectively manage the former MLIM assets along with its historical assets under management; and (17) BlackRocks success in maintaining the distribution of its products. 25 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.125 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2006. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional investors. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). Immediately following the closing, Merrill Lynch owned 45% of the voting common stock and approximately 49.3% of the total capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the combined company and PNC owned approximately 34% of the total capital stock of the combined company (as compared with 69% immediately prior to the closing). Immediately prior to the MLIM Transaction, MLIM managed approximately $589.2 billion of AUM. Concurrent with the MLIM Transaction, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch entered into a global distribution agreement, which provides a framework under which Merrill Lynch provides portfolio administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products (including those of the former MLIM business). The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non GAAP data has been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Computations for all periods presented include affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs reported as a separate income statement line item and are derived from the Companys consolidated financial statements as follows: Year ended 2006 2005 2004 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 471,800 $ 340,541 $ 165,798 Non GAAP adjustments: MLIM Transaction costs 141,932 PNC LTIP funding obligation 50,031 48,587 85,030 Fee sharing payment 34,450 Compensation expense related to deferred compensation plan asset appreciation 7,537 10,447 4,479 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,848 SSR acquisition costs 8,873 1,000 Trepp bonus 7,004 Operating income, as adjusted $ 707,598 $ 408,448 $ 263,311 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (165,364 ) (58,200 ) (42,943 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 1,909,994 $ 1,109,810 $ 682,368 Operating margin, GAAP basis 22.5 % 28.6 % 22.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.0 % 36.8 % 38.6 % Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees and compensation costs related to those transactions which were reflected in GAAP net income. Also included in MLIM Transaction costs are rebranding costs. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards met by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The 2006 fee sharing payment has been excluded because it represents a non recurring payment (based upon a performance fee) pursuant to the SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSR) acquisition agreement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in non operating income, net of the related impact on compensation expense, result in a nominal impact on net income. The portion of the current year compensation expense related to incentive awards to be funded by Merrill Lynch has been excluded from this charge because it is not expected to impact BlackRocks book value. Bonus expense related to the Companys sale of its equity interest in Trepp, LLC has been deemed to be non recurring by management and has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, in 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 27 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 SSR acquisition costs 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRocks book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of per share calculations. 28 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management BlackRock, Inc. Assets Under Management Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 All Accounts: Fixed income $ 455,931 $ 303,928 $ 240,709 50.0 % 26.3 % Equity and balanced 392,708 37,303 14,792 NM 152.2 % Cash management 227,849 86,128 78,057 164.5 % 10.3 % Alternative investment products 48,139 25,323 8,202 90.1 % 208.7 % Total $ 1,124,627 $ 452,682 $ 341,760 148.4 % 32.5 % NM Not Meaningful AUM increased approximately $671.9 billion, or 148.4%, to $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006, compared with $452.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The growth in AUM was attributable to $589.2 billion acquired in the MLIM Transaction, $32.8 billion in net subscriptions, $42.4 billion in market appreciation and $7.6 billion in foreign exchange gains. Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 564,435 $ 431,766 $ 132,669 30.7 % Cash management 202,642 106,385 96,257 90.5 % Equity and balanced 618,876 176,489 442,387 250.7 % Alternative 212,788 135,738 77,050 56.8 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 1,598,741 850,378 748,363 88.0 % Investment advisory performance fees 242,282 167,994 74,288 44.2 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 1,841,023 1,018,372 822,651 80.8 % Other revenues: BlackRock Solutions 126,350 111,526 14,824 13.3 % Other revenue 130,603 61,488 69,115 112.4 % Total other revenue 256,953 173,014 83,939 48.5 % Total revenue $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 906,590 76.1 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services. Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 945,587 $ 595,618 $ 349,969 58.8 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 165,364 58,200 107,164 184.1 % General and administration 443,260 189,522 253,738 133.9 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expense $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful 33 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7.

SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking Statements This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRocks future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as trend, potential, opportunity, pipeline, believe, comfortable, expect, anticipate, current, intention, estimate, position, assume, outlook, continue, remain, maintain, sustain, seek, achieve, and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, may or similar expressions. BlackRock cautions that forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. In addition to factors previously disclosed in BlackRocks SEC reports and those identified elsewhere in this report, including the Risk Factors section of Item 1A. of this report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management; (3) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRocks investment products, including its separately managed accounts and the former MLIM Business: (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of capital improvement projects; (6) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (7) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (8) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (9) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; (10) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock, Merrill Lynch or PNC; (11) terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries, and BlackRock; (12) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (13) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the value of advisory fees earned by BlackRock and certain investments denominated in foreign currencies; (14) the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (15) BlackRocks ability to successfully integrate the MLIM Business with its existing business; (16) the ability of BlackRock to effectively manage the former MLIM assets along with its historical assets under management; and (17) BlackRocks success in maintaining the distribution of its products. 25 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.125 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2006. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional investors. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). Immediately following the closing, Merrill Lynch owned 45% of the voting common stock and approximately 49.3% of the total capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the combined company and PNC owned approximately 34% of the total capital stock of the combined company (as compared with 69% immediately prior to the closing). Immediately prior to the MLIM Transaction, MLIM managed approximately $589.2 billion of AUM. Concurrent with the MLIM Transaction, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch entered into a global distribution agreement, which provides a framework under which Merrill Lynch provides portfolio administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products (including those of the former MLIM business). The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non GAAP data has been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Computations for all periods presented include affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs reported as a separate income statement line item and are derived from the Companys consolidated financial statements as follows: Year ended 2006 2005 2004 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 471,800 $ 340,541 $ 165,798 Non GAAP adjustments: MLIM Transaction costs 141,932 PNC LTIP funding obligation 50,031 48,587 85,030 Fee sharing payment 34,450 Compensation expense related to deferred compensation plan asset appreciation 7,537 10,447 4,479 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,848 SSR acquisition costs 8,873 1,000 Trepp bonus 7,004 Operating income, as adjusted $ 707,598 $ 408,448 $ 263,311 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (165,364 ) (58,200 ) (42,943 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 1,909,994 $ 1,109,810 $ 682,368 Operating margin, GAAP basis 22.5 % 28.6 % 22.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.0 % 36.8 % 38.6 % Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees and compensation costs related to those transactions which were reflected in GAAP net income. Also included in MLIM Transaction costs are rebranding costs. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards met by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The 2006 fee sharing payment has been excluded because it represents a non recurring payment (based upon a performance fee) pursuant to the SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSR) acquisition agreement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in non operating income, net of the related impact on compensation expense, result in a nominal impact on net income. The portion of the current year compensation expense related to incentive awards to be funded by Merrill Lynch has been excluded from this charge because it is not expected to impact BlackRocks book value. Bonus expense related to the Companys sale of its equity interest in Trepp, LLC has been deemed to be non recurring by management and has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, in 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 27 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 SSR acquisition costs 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRocks book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of per share calculations. 28 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs.

Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7.

Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.125 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2006. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional investors. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). Immediately following the closing, Merrill Lynch owned 45% of the voting common stock and approximately 49.3% of the total capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the combined company and PNC owned approximately 34% of the total capital stock of the combined company (as compared with 69% immediately prior to the closing). Immediately prior to the MLIM Transaction, MLIM managed approximately $589.2 billion of AUM. Concurrent with the MLIM Transaction, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch entered into a global distribution agreement, which provides a framework under which Merrill Lynch provides portfolio administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products (including those of the former MLIM business). The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non GAAP data has been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Computations for all periods presented include affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs reported as a separate income statement line item and are derived from the Companys consolidated financial statements as follows: Year ended 2006 2005 2004 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 471,800 $ 340,541 $ 165,798 Non GAAP adjustments: MLIM Transaction costs 141,932 PNC LTIP funding obligation 50,031 48,587 85,030 Fee sharing payment 34,450 Compensation expense related to deferred compensation plan asset appreciation 7,537 10,447 4,479 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,848 SSR acquisition costs 8,873 1,000 Trepp bonus 7,004 Operating income, as adjusted $ 707,598 $ 408,448 $ 263,311 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (165,364 ) (58,200 ) (42,943 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 1,909,994 $ 1,109,810 $ 682,368 Operating margin, GAAP basis 22.5 % 28.6 % 22.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.0 % 36.8 % 38.6 % Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees and compensation costs related to those transactions which were reflected in GAAP net income. Also included in MLIM Transaction costs are rebranding costs. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards met by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The 2006 fee sharing payment has been excluded because it represents a non recurring payment (based upon a performance fee) pursuant to the SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSR) acquisition agreement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in non operating income, net of the related impact on compensation expense, result in a nominal impact on net income. The portion of the current year compensation expense related to incentive awards to be funded by Merrill Lynch has been excluded from this charge because it is not expected to impact BlackRocks book value. Bonus expense related to the Companys sale of its equity interest in Trepp, LLC has been deemed to be non recurring by management and has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, in 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 27 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 SSR acquisition costs 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRocks book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7.

The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non GAAP data has been restated to conform to current year presentation. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Computations for all periods presented include affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs reported as a separate income statement line item and are derived from the Companys consolidated financial statements as follows: Year ended 2006 2005 2004 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 471,800 $ 340,541 $ 165,798 Non GAAP adjustments: MLIM Transaction costs 141,932 PNC LTIP funding obligation 50,031 48,587 85,030 Fee sharing payment 34,450 Compensation expense related to deferred compensation plan asset appreciation 7,537 10,447 4,479 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,848 SSR acquisition costs 8,873 1,000 Trepp bonus 7,004 Operating income, as adjusted $ 707,598 $ 408,448 $ 263,311 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (165,364 ) (58,200 ) (42,943 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 1,909,994 $ 1,109,810 $ 682,368 Operating margin, GAAP basis 22.5 % 28.6 % 22.9 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.0 % 36.8 % 38.6 % Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to, and useful to management in deciding how to, effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees and compensation costs related to those transactions which were reflected in GAAP net income. Also included in MLIM Transaction costs are rebranding costs. MLIM Transaction and SSR acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards met by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The 2006 fee sharing payment has been excluded because it represents a non recurring payment (based upon a performance fee) pursuant to the SSRM Holdings, Inc. (SSR) acquisition agreement. Compensation expense associated with appreciation on assets related to BlackRocks deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment returns on these assets reported in non operating income, net of the related impact on compensation expense, result in a nominal impact on net income. The portion of the current year compensation expense related to incentive awards to be funded by Merrill Lynch has been excluded from this charge because it is not expected to impact BlackRocks book value. Bonus expense related to the Companys sale of its equity interest in Trepp, LLC has been deemed to be non recurring by management and has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, in 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 27 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 SSR acquisition costs 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRocks book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of per share calculations. 28 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7.

Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) While BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations, and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, GAAP basis $ 322,602 $ 233,908 $ 143,141 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: MLIM Transaction costs 89,417 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 31,520 30,610 53,569 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 1,164 SSR acquisition costs 5,590 635 Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) (1,572 ) Release of reserves related to New York State and New York City tax audits (18,064 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 444,703 $ 269,622 $ 177,709 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 83,358,394 66,875,149 65,960,473 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis $ 3.87 $ 3.50 $ 2.17 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted $ 5.33 $ 4.03 $ 2.69 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Professional fees, compensation costs and rebranding costs related to the SSR acquisition and the MLIM transaction reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. MLIM transaction costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in 2006 in conjunction with the MLIM transaction. Compensation reflected in this amount represents retention payments with no future service requirement or severance payments made to certain employees as a result of the transaction. SSR acquisition costs consist of compensation costs and professional fees in 2005. Compensation reflected in this amount represents direct performance incentives paid to SSR employees assumed in conjunction with the acquisition and settled by BlackRock with no future service requirement. The portion of LTIP expense associated with awards funded by the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges have not impacted BlackRocks book value. The release of certain tax reserves and gains on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, in 2005 and 2004 to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of per share calculations. 28 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management BlackRock, Inc. Assets Under Management Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 All Accounts: Fixed income $ 455,931 $ 303,928 $ 240,709 50.0 % 26.3 % Equity and balanced 392,708 37,303 14,792 NM 152.2 % Cash management 227,849 86,128 78,057 164.5 % 10.3 % Alternative investment products 48,139 25,323 8,202 90.1 % 208.7 % Total $ 1,124,627 $ 452,682 $ 341,760 148.4 % 32.5 % NM Not Meaningful AUM increased approximately $671.9 billion, or 148.4%, to $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006, compared with $452.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The growth in AUM was attributable to $589.2 billion acquired in the MLIM Transaction, $32.8 billion in net subscriptions, $42.4 billion in market appreciation and $7.6 billion in foreign exchange gains. Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7.

Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on acquiring and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions&reg; and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 29 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

Assets Under Management Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 All Accounts: Fixed income $ 455,931 $ 303,928 $ 240,709 50.0 % 26.3 % Equity and balanced 392,708 37,303 14,792 NM 152.2 % Cash management 227,849 86,128 78,057 164.5 % 10.3 % Alternative investment products 48,139 25,323 8,202 90.1 % 208.7 % Total $ 1,124,627 $ 452,682 $ 341,760 148.4 % 32.5 % NM Not Meaningful AUM increased approximately $671.9 billion, or 148.4%, to $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006, compared with $452.7 billion at December 31, 2005. The growth in AUM was attributable to $589.2 billion acquired in the MLIM Transaction, $32.8 billion in net subscriptions, $42.4 billion in market appreciation and $7.6 billion in foreign exchange gains. Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 564,435 $ 431,766 $ 132,669 30.7 % Cash management 202,642 106,385 96,257 90.5 % Equity and balanced 618,876 176,489 442,387 250.7 % Alternative 212,788 135,738 77,050 56.8 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 1,598,741 850,378 748,363 88.0 % Investment advisory performance fees 242,282 167,994 74,288 44.2 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 1,841,023 1,018,372 822,651 80.8 % Other revenues: BlackRock Solutions 126,350 111,526 14,824 13.3 % Other revenue 130,603 61,488 69,115 112.4 % Total other revenue 256,953 173,014 83,939 48.5 % Total revenue $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 906,590 76.1 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, BlackRocks 2002 Long Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP) and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The growth in AUM was attributable to $589.2 billion acquired in the MLIM Transaction, $32.8 billion in net subscriptions, $42.4 billion in market appreciation and $7.6 billion in foreign exchange gains. Net subscriptions of $32.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily attributable to net new business of $12.4 billion in cash management products, $10.7 billion in equity and balanced products, $6.8 billion in alternative products and $3.0 billion in fixed income products. Market appreciation of $42.4 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced assets of $25.3 billion, as equity markets improved during the period ended December 31, 2006 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $14.0 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. Foreign exchange gains of $7.6 billion consisted primarily of $5.0 billion in equity and balanced assets and $2.2 billion in fixed income assets. 30 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 564,435 $ 431,766 $ 132,669 30.7 % Cash management 202,642 106,385 96,257 90.5 % Equity and balanced 618,876 176,489 442,387 250.7 % Alternative 212,788 135,738 77,050 56.8 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 1,598,741 850,378 748,363 88.0 % Investment advisory performance fees 242,282 167,994 74,288 44.2 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 1,841,023 1,018,372 822,651 80.8 % Other revenues: BlackRock Solutions 126,350 111,526 14,824 13.3 % Other revenue 130,603 61,488 69,115 112.4 % Total other revenue 256,953 173,014 83,939 48.5 % Total revenue $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 906,590 76.1 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services. Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 945,587 $ 595,618 $ 349,969 58.8 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 165,364 58,200 107,164 184.1 % General and administration 443,260 189,522 253,738 133.9 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expense $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful 33 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration (continued) General and administration expense increased $253.7 million, or 133.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $443.3 million, compared to $189.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 564,435 $ 431,766 $ 132,669 30.7 % Cash management 202,642 106,385 96,257 90.5 % Equity and balanced 618,876 176,489 442,387 250.7 % Alternative 212,788 135,738 77,050 56.8 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 1,598,741 850,378 748,363 88.0 % Investment advisory performance fees 242,282 167,994 74,288 44.2 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 1,841,023 1,018,372 822,651 80.8 % Other revenues: BlackRock Solutions 126,350 111,526 14,824 13.3 % Other revenue 130,603 61,488 69,115 112.4 % Total other revenue 256,953 173,014 83,939 48.5 % Total revenue $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 $ 906,590 76.1 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue of $257.0 million increased $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in advisory base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase in performance fees of $74.3 million, or 44.2%. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services. Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 945,587 $ 595,618 $ 349,969 58.8 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 165,364 58,200 107,164 184.1 % General and administration 443,260 189,522 253,738 133.9 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expense $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) Total expense, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 141,615 $ 60,170 $ 81,445 135.4 % Technology 68,195 22,663 45,532 200.9 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Portfolio services 51,694 14,046 37,648 268.0 % Other general and administration 117,670 56,453 61,217 108.4 % Total general and administration expense $ 443,260 $ 189,522 $ 253,738 133.9 % 34 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration (continued) General and administration expense increased $253.7 million, or 133.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $443.3 million, compared to $189.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2005.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $442.4 million in equity and balanced products, $132.7 million in fixed income products, $96.3 million in cash management products and $77.1 million in alternative products. The increase in advisory fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $152.0 billion, $141.7 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. The AUM growth in equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative products included assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction of $314.4 billion, $132.8 billion, $127.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate equity client account and the Companys other alternative products. Other Revenue Other revenue of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily represented fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $126.4 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate AUM (which represented direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $35.9 million. The increase in other revenue of $83.9 million, or 48.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to $24.6 million in distribution fees earned on mutual funds, increased revenues of $14.8 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services and $12.6 million in fund accounting services.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) Total expense, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a one time fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $350.0 million, or 58.8%, to $945.6 million, compared to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, or 71.6%, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, or 54.0%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.2 million to $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration (continued) General and administration expense increased $253.7 million, or 133.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $443.3 million, compared to $189.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration (continued) General and administration expense increased $253.7 million, or 133.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $443.3 million, compared to $189.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $81.4 million, technology related expense of $45.5 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $61.2 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction. Marketing and promotional expense increased $81.4 million, or 135.4%, to $141.6 million, compared to $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to increased marketing activities of $61.1 million (which included $28.2 million related to BlackRocks rebranding campaign and $6.7 million of additional MLIM related marketing expense) and $20.4 million of increased amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $45.5 million to $68.2 million, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services costs increased $37.6 million to $51.7 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily reflect costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities associated with the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Other general and administration costs increased to $117.7 million from $56.5 million, and included $32.9 million in professional fees related to the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a one time expense related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income and Minority Interest Non operating income increased $21.2 million, or 60.3%, to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $23.2 million, or 53.8%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense related to liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2006 and investments acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in consolidated investments, the majority of which were acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2005. (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2004 Netsubscriptions(redemptions) Acquisition Marketappreciation(depreciation) December 31,2005 All Accounts: Fixed income $ 240,709 $ 37,329 $ 21,083 $ 4,807 $ 303,928 Equity and balanced 14,792 1,644 17,558 3,309 37,303 Cash management 78,057 7,150 768 153 86,128 Alternative investment products 8,202 4,032 10,557 2,532 25,323 Total $ 341,760 $ 50,155 $ 49,966 $ 10,801 $ 452,682 Revenue Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 431,766 $ 372,973 $ 58,793 15.8 % Cash management 106,385 99,080 7,305 7.4 % Equity and balanced 176,489 59,322 117,167 197.5 % Alternative 135,738 60,642 75,096 123.8 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 850,378 592,017 258,361 43.6 % Investment advisory performance fees 167,994 41,606 126,388 303.8 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 1,018,372 633,623 384,749 60.7 % Other revenues: BlackRock Solutions 111,526 80,541 30,984 38.5 % Other revenue 61,488 11,147 50,342 451.7 % Total other revenue 173,014 91,688 81,326 88.7 % Total revenue $ 1,191,386 $ 725,311 $ 466,075 64.3 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $466.1 million, or 64.3%, to $1,191.4 million, compared with $725.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and increased $88.7 million, or 37.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded in January 2007 by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, integration expenses related to the MLIM Transaction and a contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $31.5 million, $90.6 million and $89.4 million, respectively. MLIM Transaction costs primarily include professional fees, compensation expense and other general and administration expenses. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $30.6 million and expenses related to the SSR acquisition of $5.6 million. SSR acquisition costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, as adjusted, increased $175.1 million, or 64.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2005.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage.

Investment advisory and administration fees increased $384.7 million, or 60.7% to $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $633.6 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other revenue increased by $81.3 million, or 88.7%, to $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $384.7 million, or 60.7%, was comprised of higher advisory base fees of $258.4 million, or 43.6%, to $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $592.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 along with an increase in performance fees of $126.4 million. Investment advisory base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased AUM of $110.9 billion as a result of net new subscriptions of $50.2 billion, $50.0 billion of AUM acquired primarily in the Companys acquisition of SSR and $10.8 billion due to market appreciation. The increase in base investment advisory fees of $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted of increases of $117.2 million in equity products, $75.1 million in alternative products, $58.8 million in fixed income products and $7.3 million in cash management products. The $117.2 million increase in advisory fees from equity products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $17.6 billion and market appreciation of $3.3 billion. The $75.1 million increase in advisory fees from alternative products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from the SSR acquisition of $10.6 billion and net subscriptions of $4.0 billion. The $58.8 million increase in advisory fees from fixed income products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $37.3 billion, the SSR acquisition of $21.1 billion and market appreciation of $4.8 billion. The $7.3 million increase in advisory fees from cash management products was primarily the result of an increase in AUM from net subscriptions of $7.2 million. Performance fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on the Companys equity hedge funds and real estate alternative products acquired in the SSR acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue of $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $111.5 million, property management fees of $32.3 million earned on real estate AUM (which represent direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees) and distribution fees earned on BlackRock funds of $11.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $81.3 million, or 88.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of property management fees of $32.3 million (which includes $23.4 million of direct reimbursement of the salaries of certain Realty employees), increased revenues of $31.0 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new assignments and distribution fees of $11.3 million earned on funds obtained in the SSR acquisition. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % Expense: Employee compensation and benefits $ 595,618 $ 391,138 $ 204,480 52.3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 58,200 42,943 15,257 35.5 % General and administration 189,522 118,388 71,134 60.1 % Amortization of intangible assets 7,505 947 6,558 NM Impairment of intangible assets 6,097 (6,097 ) (100 %) Total expense $ 850,845 $ 559,513 $ 291,332 52.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expense increased $291.3 million, or 52.1%, to $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $559.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to increases in compensation and benefits (other than the LTIP component of this expense, which decreased by $44.6 million), general and administration expense, portfolio administration and servicing costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease in LTIP expense of $44.6 million and the recognition of an impairment of an acquired management contract of $6.1 million during the first quarter of 2004. Employee compensation and benefits Compensation and benefits expense increased by $204.5 million, or 52.3%, to $595.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $391.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $123.0 million and $122.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $44.6 million decrease in LTIP costs, for which the Company initiated expense recognition during the third quarter of 2004. The increase of $123.0 million in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the SSR acquisition, which added 858 employees (including 511 Realty employees whose salaries are entirely reimbursed). The $122.1 million, or 85.6%, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to operating income growth, additional SSR employees, higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and a $6.5 million acquisition related bonus payment to continuing employees. Portfolio administration and servicing costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $15.3 million, or 35.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $58.2 million, compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The rise was due to increases in shareholder servicing fees related to new closed end funds and additional assets associated with BlackRock funds. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Expense (continued) General and Administration Year ended December 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Amount % General and administration expense: Marketing and promotional $ 60,170 $ 27,252 $ 32,918 120.8 % Occupancy 36,190 23,407 12,783 54.6 % Technology 22,663 18,835 3,828 20.3 % Portfolio services 14,046 7,129 6,917 97.0 % Other general and administration 56,453 41,765 14,688 35.2 % Total general and administration expense $ 189,522 $ 118,388 $ 71,134 60.1 % General and administration expense increased $71.1 million, or 60.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2005 to $189.5 million, compared to $118.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $32.9 million, occupancy expense of $12.8 million, portfolio services expense of $6.9 million, technology expense of $3.8 million and other general and administration expense of $14.7 million. Marketing and promotional expense increased $32.9 million, or 120.8%, to $60.2 million, compared to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased marketing activities of $23.6 million associated with the Companys institutional products and expanded international calling efforts, which included closed end fund launch costs of $13.3 million for the year and $9.3 million in amortization of deferred mutual fund commissions assumed in the SSR acquisition. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $36.2 million, representing a $12.8 million, or 54.6%, increase, from $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in occupancy costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflected costs related to occupying 85,000 square feet of additional office space in New York during the first quarter of 2005 and costs related to properties assumed in the SSR acquisition. Portfolio services costs increased by 97.0% to $14.0 million, related to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Technology expenses increased $3.8 million, or 20.3%, to $22.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased software maintenance expenses, consulting expenses and additional depreciation on assets assumed in the SSR acquisition to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by 35.2% to $56.5 million and included a $3.2 million increase in office related expenses consistent with the increases in office space and number of employees and a $2.7 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the SSR integration and Sarbanes Oxley Act and other compliance activities. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $6.6 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the SSR acquisition. During the first quarter 2004, in connection with the liquidation of a certain equity hedge fund, the Company recognized a $6.1 million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the funds acquired management contract. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004 (continued) Non Operating Income Non operating income increased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a result of a $7.7 million, or 21.6%, increase in investment income, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in interest expense. The increase in investment income was primarily due to market appreciation and security gains on Company investments in 2005, partially offset by the Companys $12.9 million gain on the sale of Trepp, LLC in April 2004. Borrowings used to finance the SSR acquisition resulted in $6.6 million of the increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $138.6 million and $52.3 million, representing effective tax rates of 37.2% and 26.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the Companys effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately $18.1 million in 2004 primarily associated with the resolution of an audit performed by New York State on the Companys state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001. Net Income Net income totaled $233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and includes the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and expenses related to the SSR acquisition, of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR acquisition costs include acquisition related bonus payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and certain professional fees. In addition, net income of $143.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of common stock held by PNC of $53.6 million, New York State tax benefits and the impact of the sale of Trepp, LLC, discussed previously. Exclusive of these items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as adjusted, increased $91.9 million, or 51.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Business Outlook As fiscal 2007 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected positive economic and market performance, although they retrenched at the end of February. While management expects overall positive equity markets during 2007, that growth may be more volatile than during 2006. The timing and direction of market changes and the timing of new client asset flows will impact the timing and amount of revenue the Company recognizes. As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide earnings guidance. However, in the fourth quarter earnings release, the Company included information about the MLIM integration and an estimated range for 2007 earnings. The range was based on a number of factors, including a performance fee range of $100 to $250 million and an assumed growth in the equity markets from year end 2006 levels. Based on current market conditions, the Company expects performance fees to be nearer the lower end of the range. The Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 23, 2007 payment, to $0.67 per share from $0.42 per share paid in 2006. Operating cash flows will be used to pay dividends, to invest in new products, expand the global footprint, to meet ongoing global net capital requirements, principally outside the United States, and to repay amounts under the revolving credit facility to the extent available. The Company expects to continue to utilize its revolving credit facility described below to fund U.S. activities throughout 2007 even though it will have excess cash outside the United States. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys long term debt, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and dividends on BlackRocks stock. Management believes that the Company has sufficient access to cash through its operations and the revolving credit facility described below to fund its operations in the near term. Cash provided by the Companys operating activities totaled $720.9 million, $254.9 million and $231.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $480.9 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of net income resulting from the MLIM Transaction and organic growth. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. The term of the facility is five years and interest currently accrues at the applicable London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20%. The Company pays a commitment fee of 0.04% per annum on the undrawn balance. Additionally, for each day that the total amount outstanding is greater than 50% of the total commitments by all lenders, the Company pays a utilization fee of 0.05% per annum on the total amount outstanding. Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require BlackRock to maintain a maximum debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and a minimum EBITDA/interest expense ratio of 4.0. The facility is intended to fund various investment opportunities as well as BlackRocks near term operating cash requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. In February 2007, the Company exercised its ability to increase the capacity of the facility to $800.0 million. The Credit Agreement allows BlackRock to request an additional $200 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $1 billion. During January and February 2007, the Company borrowed $540.0 million against this facility for general corporate purposes. The term for the outstanding debt is one month and as of February 28, 2007 accrues interest at a rate of 5.52%. Borrowings outstanding at February 28, 2007 are due March 13, 2007 and the Company has provided notice that it will continue $450 million of such borrowings. BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. These shares have been retained as treasury stock. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish funds of private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company has various capital commitments to fund other companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is uncertain. As of December 31, 2006, these unfunded commitments totaled approximately $210.0 million. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $219.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3.6 and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of $272.4 million in net cash acquired in the MLIM Transaction and other acquisitions, partially offset by $212.6 million in purchases of investments and $84.0 million of capital expenditures primarily related to MLIM integration activities. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $275.2 million in cash consideration paid in the SSR acquisition and $55.2 million in capital expenditures primarily representing build out costs associated with additional office space in New York and purchases of $51.6 million in investments, which was partially offset by the sale of real estate held for sale for $112.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $84.9 million, $4.3 million and $99.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities primarily represented the payment of $135.7 million in dividends and common stock repurchases of $30.9 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $72.6 million in net subscriptions received from minority interest holders in consolidated investments. In January 2004, BlackRocks Board of Directors approved a two million share repurchase program. The Company repurchased all remaining 180,825 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $72.0 million during the seven months ended July 31, 2006. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board had authorized a new program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company made no repurchases of shares under the new program during the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, long term debt, including current maturities, was $253.2 million. Debt service requirements are $6.9 million in 2007, $6.8 million in 2008 and $6.7 million in 2009 and 2010. Approximately $90.9 million in cash and cash equivalents included in the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition is held by products that are consolidated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). As such, the Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006 are held by products that are consolidated in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be readily able to sell such investments in order to obtain cash for use in its operations. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2006, the Company was required to maintain approximately $344.3 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 43 Item 7.

Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (Dollar amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Contractual Obligations: Convertible Debentures $ 270,603 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 6,563 $ 250,914 $ $ Lease Commitments 538,253 70,590 74,065 70,933 68,851 63,317 190,497 Purchase Obligations 774,881 399,562 370,638 4,676 5 Investment Commitments 328,983 31,122 10,795 39,397 2,350 245,319 Acquired Management Contract 4,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,916,720 $ 508,837 $ 463,061 $ 83,172 $ 360,167 $ 65,667 $ 435,816 Convertible Debentures, Line of Credit and Other Interest Bearing Obligations In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum (the Debentures). Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million a year, and commenced August 15, 2005. The Debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the Debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the Debentures is assumed to be repaid in 2010, and related interest has been included through the call date. In December 2006, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banking institutions with an initial borrowing capacity of $600.0 million, subsequently increased in February 2007 to $800.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under this facility as the first borrowings were made in January and February of 2007. As such, no amounts related to the revolving credit facility have been included in the contractual obligations table above. Lease Commitments The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2018. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2006, the Companys obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the BlackRock closed end funds, sub advisory agreements and standard service contracts with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties for portfolio, market data and office services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, these obligations are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Investment Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is dependent upon the needs of the investment and, therefore, is uncertain. Capital commitments have been shown in the contractual obligations table above to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2006. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Investment Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. The Companys Investment Committee has approved warehouse facilities totaling $350 million for the purpose of funding investments to establish private equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has committed to invest $130 million in certain funds, of which approximately $11 million was funded. The net unfunded commitment of $119 million has been included in the contractual obligations table above. Acquired Management Contract In connection with a management contract acquired on May 15, 2000, which was associated with the agreement and plan of merger of CORE Cap, Inc. with Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a BlackRock managed Real Estate Investment Trust, the Company recorded an $8.0 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10.0%, the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the related interest expense was $0.3 million. At December 31, 2006, the future commitment under the agreement is $4.0 million and has been included in the contractual obligations table above. If Anthracites management contract is terminated, not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause, Anthracite would remit to the Company all future payments due under this obligation. At December 31, 2006, the discounted value of this obligation was $3.2 million and was included in long term borrowings in the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) LTIP Put Obligation and Other Compensation and Benefit Obligations BlackRock granted awards in 2002 and 2003 under its LTIP of approximately $230 million, of which approximately $210 million were paid in January 2007. The awards were payable approximately 16.7% in cash and the remainder in BlackRock stock contributed by PNC and distributed to LTIP participants. As permitted under the plan, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to the Company at a total fair market value of approximately $165.7 million. In accordance with GAAP, this amount was not recorded on the statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2006 as the total put obligation was not known or estimable until January 2007. As such, this obligation was not included in the contractual obligations table above. The Company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, employee stock purchases and defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, defined benefit plan obligations, post employment benefits and post retirement benefits that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2006 totaled $1,051.3 million and included incentive compensation of $629.9 million, deferred compensation of $321.6 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $99.8 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in January and February 2007, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years, but include certain defined benefit plan liabilities whose payment patterns are uncertain. Acquisition Forward Commitment On April 30, 2003, the Company purchased 80% of an investment manager of a fund of hedge funds for approximately $4.1 million in cash. Additionally, the Company committed to purchase the remaining 20% equity of the investment manager on March 31, 2008, subject to certain acceleration provisions. The purchase price of this remaining interest is performance based and is not subject to a minimum or maximum amount or to the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the Company. As the remaining obligation is dependent upon the performance of the investment manager through March 31, 2008, however, the ultimate liability is not certain at December 31, 2006 and, as such, this commitment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from BlackRocks consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. Purchase Price Contingencies In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSR from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR acquisition, MetLife could receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Due to its inherent uncertainty, this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and has not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company, which was acquired in the MLIM Transaction, maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue directly to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $4.3 billion of separate account liabilities on the 2006 consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM Transaction Agreement, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2006. See further discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method The accounting method used for the Companys investments is generally dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which is generally shown through a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member, is generally presumed to control investments in limited partnerships and certain limited liability companies. Such a presumption can be overcome if other limited partners or members in the investment have substantive participating or kick out rights whereby the Company may be removed as investment manager. For investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting for investments, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income is recorded as non operating income for investments in funds and as other revenue for investments in operating or advisory companies since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. Dividends received reduce the Companys investment balance. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable, the investments are classified as either trading or available for sale securities based upon managements intent in making the investment. Trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in non operating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change. Available for sale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of an available for sale security, the Company reclassifies the gain or loss on the security from accumulated other comprehensive income to non operating income on the Companys consolidated financial statements. For equity investments where BlackRock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are non marketable, the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, dividends received are recorded as non operating income. Debt securities are classified as either held to maturity or as available for sale based upon managements purpose for making the investment. If the Company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity, the security is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition. If the Company does not have the intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so, the security is classified as available for sale. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A.

The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation, Equity Method and Cost Method (continued) Dividend income on the Companys investments in CDOs is recorded based upon the CDOs projected investment yield. Expected future cash flows for the CDO are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively. Dividend income for these investments is recorded in non operating income on the consolidated statements of income. Occasionally, the Company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund. All of the consolidated funds investments are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the securities fair values reflected in non operating income in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the absence of a publicly available market value, fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on such factors as the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and, in the case of private investment fund investments, the net asset value as provided by the private investment funds investment manager which may or may not be BlackRock. When the Company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method, as appropriate. The evaluation of the control or significant influence that BlackRock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement with the investee and any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee. Further, with regard to variable interest entities, significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. Fair Value BlackRock has certain investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles as described above. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated fund investments, changes in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services. Non marketable securities, however, are generally priced using a variety of methods and resources, including internal valuation models, which utilize available market data and management assumptions. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Investments (continued) Fair Value (continued) When launching a new fund, the Company will, on occasion, provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors. In such circumstances, the Company will usually own 100% of the fund until it is offered to external investors and, as such, these funds are consolidated in BlackRocks financial statements. Investments within such funds are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value impacting the Companys consolidated statements of income. Investments held by these seed funds may be marketable or non marketable depending upon the type of fund being established. Fair value of non marketable investments within these funds is generally determined by the Company, as the fund manager, using similar models, assumptions and judgment as noted above. In addition, changes in fair value of certain illiquid investments held by these funds, including direct investments in equity or debt securities of privately held companies certain real estate products are recorded based upon the best information available at the reporting period date, considering any significant changes in the operations of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, BlackRock had approximately $2.1 billion in investments. Of that amount, changes in fair value of approximately $1.9 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statement of income and approximately $0.2 billion will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.5 billion of such investments relate to consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and minority interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. Due to ownership levels, BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such investments is $0.4 billion. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair values of trading or available for sale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values, the Company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company reviews its CDO investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment. The Company estimates the fair value of its CDO investments using the present value of future cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate, an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary. CDO impairments were $2.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million.

Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2006, ranged from 2 to 20 years with an original weighted average estimated useful life of 10.1 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as assets under management, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of finite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $6.1 million with regard to an acquired management contract. No such impairments were recorded in 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate Risk The following table summarizes the fair value of BlackRocks investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities that expose BlackRock to interest rate risk at December 31, 2006. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2006 Goodwill $ 5,257,017 Management contracts acquired: Indefinitelived 4,711,732 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,170,698 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,139,447 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset.

The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve: (Dollar amounts in thousands) BookValue Fair market value assuming +100 basis point shift Fair market value assuming 100 basis point shift December 31, 2006 Municipal debt securities $ 154,510 $ 130,224 $ 178,796 Corporate notes and bonds 13,656 13,192 14,120 Commingled investments 23,272 23,275 23,269 Total trading investments 191,438 166,691 216,185 Commingled investments 48,377 48,305 48,449 Collateralized debt obligations 29,362 29,346 29,378 Other 3,431 3,397 3,465 Total available for sale investments 81,170 81,048 81,292 Other fund investments 70,962 71,209 70,715 Total investments $ 343,570 $ 318,948 $ 368,192 December 31, 2005 Mortgage backed securities $ 13,069 $ 12,827 $ 13,311 Corporate notes and bonds 7,946 7,575 8,262 Municipal debt securities 123 117 128 Total trading investments 21,138 20,519 21,701 Commingled investments 3,543 3,426 3,660 Collateralized debt obligations 25,717 25,222 26,212 Total available for sale investments 29,260 28,648 29,872 Other fund investments 96,449 94,998 97,900 Total investments $ 146,847 $ 144,165 $ 149,473 55 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company has increased its foreign exchange rate risk as a result of the MLIM Transaction. The Company has investments totaling approximately $163.0 million that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the euro. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or a decline in value of the investment portfolio of approximately $16.3 million. In addition, the Company maintains certain foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaling approximately $783.1 million at December 31, 2006, primarily in British pounds sterling. A 10% increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in an increase or decline in value of such cash accounts of approximately $78.3 million. Other Market Risks In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures, which will be due in 2035 and bear interest at 2.625% per annum. Due to the debentures conversion feature, these financial instruments are exposed to both interest rate risk and equity price risk. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures was $372.8 million. Assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $365.7 million and $379.9 million, respectively. Assuming a 10% increase and 10% decrease in the Companys stock price, based on the fair value of the debentures on December 31, 2006, the fair value of the debentures would fluctuate to $404.9 million and $341.2 million, respectively. In addition, BlackRocks investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. Declines in equity market prices or interest rates, or both, could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: causing the value of AUM to decrease; causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease; causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the Company does not serve; and causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that BlackRock manages into investments that BlackRock does not manage. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future earnings, future deductibility of the asset, changes in tax law and other factors. If management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in a charge to the Companys consolidated statement of income. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax liability. The Companys actual tax benefit or liability may differ from these estimates. Current and deferred tax balances require significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $14.7 million and had recorded no valuation allowances against those assets. The Company also had approximately $1.7 billion in deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2006. The Company had income taxes receivable of approximately $42.1 million and income taxes payable of $171.3 million as of December 31, 2006. PNC and BlackRock have entered into a tax disaffiliation agreement that sets forth each partys rights and obligations with respect to income tax payments and refunds and addresses related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of audits or other proceedings involving claims made by taxing authorities. As such, the Company may be responsible for its pro rata share of tax positions taken by PNC for unaudited tax years which may be subsequently challenged by taxing authorities. Management does not anticipate that any such amounts would be material to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on where noted pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. Subsequent to the MLIM Transaction, the Company contracts with third parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements are generally priced at a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party (retrocessions). The Company accounts for retrocessions in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and has recorded its retrocession contracts net of management fees earned because management believes that the Company is not the primary obligor of the arrangement, does not perform part of the service, is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and has no credit risk. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $156.0 million and were included in investment advisory and administration fees on the 2006 consolidated statement of income. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from certain alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, performance fee revenue totaled $242.3 million, $168.0 million and $41.6 million, respectively. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to customers. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are either based on pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services, on fixed monthly or quarterly payments or on attainment of certain pre defined milestones. The fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of AUM are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in Investments above to the extent the underlying investments are non marketable and, as such, the Companys earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates. In addition, certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of AUM or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period. Further, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Management does not believe this exposure is material to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Historically, adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of BlackRocks fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments and since, as a policy, the Company does not record revenues until they are relatively certain. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 53 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. The tables below represent BlackRocks total consolidated investment portfolio. Approximately $1,515.8 million of BlackRocks total investment portfolio is maintained in investment funds which are consolidated in accordance with GAAP even though BlackRock may or may not own a majority of such funds. Equity risk inherent in those funds, as displayed below, would be limited to its net exposure of $370.3 million on these investments. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including in the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Investment Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. Equity Market Price Risk BlackRocks investments, including consolidated investments, may expose BlackRock to equity price risk. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices: (Dollar amounts in thousands) Book Value Fair value assuming 10% increase Fair value assuming 10% decrease December 31, 2006 Equity securities $ 155,930 $ 171,523 $ 140,337 Commingled investments 125,115 137,627 112,604 Total investments, trading 281,045 309,150 252,941 Commingled investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Total available for sale investments 77,272 84,999 69,545 Other fund investments 1,377,541 1,515,295 1,239,787 Deferred compensation plans 18,146 19,961 16,331 Total other investments 1,395,687 1,535,256 1,256,118 Total equity price risk on investments $ 1,754,004 $ 1,929,405 $ 1,578,604 December 31, 2005 Commingled investments $ 22,319 $ 24,550 $ 20,087 Equity securities 18,425 20,267 16,582 Total investments, trading 40,744 44,817 36,669 Commingled investments 766 842 689 Total available for sale investments 766 842 689 Other fund investments 84,843 93,327 76,358 Deferred compensation plans 24,495 26,944 22,045 Other 973 1,070 875 Total equity investments 110,311 121,341 99,278 Total equity price risk on investments $ 151,821 $ 167,000 $ 136,636 BlackRocks deferred compensation plans comprise $31.3 million and $22.3 million of total trading investments, and $18.1 million and $24.5 million of total other investments, at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and reflect investments held by BlackRock with respect to senior employee elections under BlackRocks deferred compensation plans. Any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation expense. During 2007, the Company established a hedging program to hedge exposure to equity price risk in certain investments through the use of derivative instruments. 54 Item 7A.
