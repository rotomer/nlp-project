MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.357 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2007. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2007, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 45.1% of the Companys voting common stock and approximately 49.0% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the Company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 33.5% of the capital stock. The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. As a result of recent changes in BlackRocks business, management has altered the way it views its operating margin, as adjusted. As such, the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, were modified in the second quarter 2007 primarily to adjust for costs associated with closed end fund issuances and amortization of deferred sales costs, as shown below. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, for all periods presented includes affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. Computations for all years are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: Year ended 2007 2006 2005 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,293,664 $ 471,800 $ 340,541 Non GAAP adjustments: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 PNC LTIP funding obligation 53,517 50,031 48,587 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10,000 1,848 MLIM integration costs 20,201 141,932 Quellos integration costs 460 SSR integration costs 8,873 Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 13,259 Closed end fund launch commissions 6,029 3,374 4,105 Compensation expense related to appreciation on deferred compensation plans 11,844 7,537 10,447 Operating income, as adjusted $ 1,559,423 $ 688,108 $ 425,812 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (547,620 ) (172,531 ) (64,611 ) Amortization of deferred sales costs (108,091 ) (29,940 ) (9,346 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (26,811 ) (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted $ 4,162,133 $ 1,872,887 $ 1,094,053 Operating margin, GAAP basis 26.7 % 22.5 % 28.6 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.5 % 36.7 % 38.9 % 30 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non operating income. Non GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 Quellos integration costs 294 SSR integration costs 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking Statements This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRocks future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as trend, potential, opportunity, pipeline, believe, comfortable, expect, anticipate, current, intention, estimate, position, assume, outlook, continue, remain, maintain, sustain, seek, achieve, and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, may or similar expressions. BlackRock cautions that forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. In addition to factors previously disclosed in BlackRocks SEC reports and those identified elsewhere in this report, including the Risk Factors section of Item 1A. of this report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management; (3) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRocks investment products; (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of capital improvement projects; (6) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (7) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (8) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (9) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; (10) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock, Merrill Lynch or PNC; (11) terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries, and BlackRock; (12) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (13) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRocks investments; (14) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the value of advisory and administration fees earned by BlackRock and the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies; (15) the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (16) BlackRocks ability to successfully integrate the MLIM and Quellos Businesses with its existing business; (17) the ability of BlackRock to effectively manage the former MLIM and Quellos assets along with its historical assets under management; and (18) BlackRocks success in maintaining the distribution of its products. 28 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.357 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2007. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2007, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 45.1% of the Companys voting common stock and approximately 49.0% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the Company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 33.5% of the capital stock. The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. As a result of recent changes in BlackRocks business, management has altered the way it views its operating margin, as adjusted. As such, the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, were modified in the second quarter 2007 primarily to adjust for costs associated with closed end fund issuances and amortization of deferred sales costs, as shown below. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, for all periods presented includes affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. Computations for all years are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: Year ended 2007 2006 2005 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,293,664 $ 471,800 $ 340,541 Non GAAP adjustments: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 PNC LTIP funding obligation 53,517 50,031 48,587 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10,000 1,848 MLIM integration costs 20,201 141,932 Quellos integration costs 460 SSR integration costs 8,873 Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 13,259 Closed end fund launch commissions 6,029 3,374 4,105 Compensation expense related to appreciation on deferred compensation plans 11,844 7,537 10,447 Operating income, as adjusted $ 1,559,423 $ 688,108 $ 425,812 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (547,620 ) (172,531 ) (64,611 ) Amortization of deferred sales costs (108,091 ) (29,940 ) (9,346 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (26,811 ) (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted $ 4,162,133 $ 1,872,887 $ 1,094,053 Operating margin, GAAP basis 26.7 % 22.5 % 28.6 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.5 % 36.7 % 38.9 % 30 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non operating income. Non GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 Quellos integration costs 294 SSR integration costs 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior year data reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006.

Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.357 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2007. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock provides risk management, strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. On September 29, 2006, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) closed a transaction pursuant to which Merrill Lynch contributed its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for an aggregate of 65 million shares of newly issued BlackRock common and non voting participating preferred stock (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2007, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 45.1% of the Companys voting common stock and approximately 49.0% of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis of the Company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 33.5% of the capital stock. The following table summarizes BlackRocks operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. As a result of recent changes in BlackRocks business, management has altered the way it views its operating margin, as adjusted. As such, the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, were modified in the second quarter 2007 primarily to adjust for costs associated with closed end fund issuances and amortization of deferred sales costs, as shown below. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, for all periods presented includes affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. Computations for all years are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: Year ended 2007 2006 2005 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,293,664 $ 471,800 $ 340,541 Non GAAP adjustments: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 PNC LTIP funding obligation 53,517 50,031 48,587 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10,000 1,848 MLIM integration costs 20,201 141,932 Quellos integration costs 460 SSR integration costs 8,873 Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 13,259 Closed end fund launch commissions 6,029 3,374 4,105 Compensation expense related to appreciation on deferred compensation plans 11,844 7,537 10,447 Operating income, as adjusted $ 1,559,423 $ 688,108 $ 425,812 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (547,620 ) (172,531 ) (64,611 ) Amortization of deferred sales costs (108,091 ) (29,940 ) (9,346 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (26,811 ) (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted $ 4,162,133 $ 1,872,887 $ 1,094,053 Operating margin, GAAP basis 26.7 % 22.5 % 28.6 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.5 % 36.7 % 38.9 % 30 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non operating income. Non GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (a) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. As a result of recent changes in BlackRocks business, management has altered the way it views its operating margin, as adjusted. As such, the calculation of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, were modified in the second quarter 2007 primarily to adjust for costs associated with closed end fund issuances and amortization of deferred sales costs, as shown below. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, for all periods presented includes affiliated and unaffiliated portfolio administration and servicing costs. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current presentation. Computations for all years are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: Year ended 2007 2006 2005 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,293,664 $ 471,800 $ 340,541 Non GAAP adjustments: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 PNC LTIP funding obligation 53,517 50,031 48,587 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10,000 1,848 MLIM integration costs 20,201 141,932 Quellos integration costs 460 SSR integration costs 8,873 Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 13,259 Closed end fund launch commissions 6,029 3,374 4,105 Compensation expense related to appreciation on deferred compensation plans 11,844 7,537 10,447 Operating income, as adjusted $ 1,559,423 $ 688,108 $ 425,812 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 1,191,386 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (547,620 ) (172,531 ) (64,611 ) Amortization of deferred sales costs (108,091 ) (29,940 ) (9,346 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (26,811 ) (22,618 ) (23,376 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted $ 4,162,133 $ 1,872,887 $ 1,094,053 Operating margin, GAAP basis 26.7 % 22.5 % 28.6 % Operating margin, as adjusted 37.5 % 36.7 % 38.9 % 30 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non operating income. Non GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 Quellos integration costs 294 SSR integration costs 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior year data reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction.

The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of managements ability to effectively employ BlackRocks resources. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Non GAAP Operating Income Adjustments: The expense related to the termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM and Quellos integration costs, as well as SSR acquisition costs consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs related to the integration which were reflected in GAAP operating income. Integration and acquisition costs have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. Closed end fund launch costs and commissions have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because such costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of such costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments for these plans are reported in non operating income. Non GAAP Revenue Adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because the Company receives offsetting revenue and expense for these services. Amortization of deferred sales costs are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to certain BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty) personnel. These employees are retained on Realtys payroll when certain properties are acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits are fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 31 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 Quellos integration costs 294 SSR integration costs 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) (b) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis, however management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income, GAAP basis $ 995,272 $ 322,602 $ 233,908 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 81,993 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 34,251 31,520 30,610 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 6,400 1,164 MLIM integration costs 12,929 89,417 Quellos integration costs 294 SSR integration costs 5,590 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51,445 ) Impact of Trepp sale (486 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 1,079,694 $ 444,703 $ 269,622 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (c) 132,088,810 83,358,394 66,875,149 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (c) $ 7.53 $ 3.87 $ 3.50 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (c) $ 8.17 $ 5.33 $ 4.03 Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are effective measurements of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. The portion of the LTIP expense associated with awards funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock common stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to LTIP participants put options, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. MLIM, Quellos and SSR integration costs, reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. Integration costs consist principally of compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs incurred in conjunction with the integrations. The United Kingdom and Germany, during third quarter 2007, enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in deferred income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to prior reporting periods. The gain on the sale of the Companys equity interest in Trepp, LLC reflected in GAAP net income, has been deemed non recurring by management and has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to subsequent reporting periods. (c) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth.

Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan and Australia. The Company provides a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products to a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The primary retail fund group offered outside the United States is the Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds (MLIIF), which is authorized for distribution in more than 35 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include a wide variety of open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes certain of its products and services through Merrill Lynch. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on AUM. Performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions services are based on a number of factors including pre determined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts, or fixed fees. Fees earned on risk management, investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of income. 33 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior year data reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $832.2 million, or 89.0%, to $1,767.1 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $436.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31 2007 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $23.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 payable to PNC and other affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $78.2 million to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities and PNC affiliated entities, as well as third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Assets Under Management AUM increased approximately $232.0 billion, or 20.6%, to $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.125 trillion at December 31, 2006. The growth in AUM was attributable to $137.6 billion in net subscriptions, $60.1 billion in net market appreciation, $21.9 billion acquired in the Quellos Transaction and $12.4 billion in net foreign exchange gains.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior year data reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Net subscriptions of $137.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily the result of net new business of $75.3 billion in cash management products, $27.2 billion in fixed income products, $23.5 billion in equity and balanced products and $11.7 billion in alternative investment products. Market appreciation of $60.1 billion largely reflected appreciation in equity and balanced products of $35.0 billion, as equity markets improved during the year ended December 31, 2007 and market appreciation on fixed income products of $20.1 billion due to current income and changes in market interest rates. BlackRock acquired $21.9 billion in alternative investment products from the Quellos Transaction. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Prior year data reflects certain reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767,063 $ 934,887 $ 832,176 89.0 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 547,620 172,531 375,089 217.4 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 108,091 29,940 78,151 261.0 % General and administration 870,367 416,853 453,514 108.8 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128,114 128,114 NM Fee sharing payment 34,450 (34,450 ) (100.0 )% Amortization of intangible assets 129,736 37,515 92,221 245.8 % Total expenses $ 3,550,991 $ 1,626,176 $ 1,924,815 118.4 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,924.8 million, or 118.4%, to $3,551.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $832.2 million, or 89.0%, to $1,767.1 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook As fiscal 2008 began, domestic and international markets generally reflected mixed economic and market performance due to a downturn in the United States housing market and ongoing credit market concerns. Low interest rates and a weaker dollar suggest increased allocations outside the United States over time, as well as faster adoption of new strategies, including liability driven investing, the increased use of multiple asset class products and the mainstreaming of alternatives. The timing and direction of market changes, investment performance and new client asset flows will impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The Company notes that the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, which may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2008. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable retention of a portion of these assets. The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. In early 2008, returns on many major equity indices have declined from year end 2007, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 917,390 $ 590,225 $ 327,165 55.4 % Equity and balanced 2,202,076 625,390 1,576,686 252.1 % Cash management 519,733 202,515 317,218 156.6 % Alternative investments 370,862 180,611 190,251 105.3 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,010,061 1,598,741 2,411,320 150.8 % Investment advisory performance fees 350,188 242,282 107,906 44.5 % Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,360,249 1,841,023 2,519,226 136.8 % Distribution fees 123,052 35,903 87,149 242.7 % Other revenue: BlackRock Solutions 198,262 147,987 50,275 34.0 % Other revenue 163,092 73,063 90,029 123.2 % Total other revenue 361,354 221,050 140,304 63.5 % Total revenue $ 4,844,655 $ 2,097,976 $ 2,746,679 130.9 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,746.7 million, or 130.9%, to $4,844.7 million, compared with $2,098.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $832.2 million, or 89.0%, to $1,767.1 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375.1 million to $547.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $172.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $436.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31 2007 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $23.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 payable to PNC and other affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $78.2 million to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 169,676 $ 51,694 $ 117,982 228.2 % Marketing and promotional 169,206 100,089 69,117 69.1 % Occupancy 130,089 64,086 66,003 103.0 % Technology 117,597 61,040 56,557 92.7 % Professional services 94,282 72,740 21,542 29.6 % Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 24,008 207.2 % Other general and administration 153,923 55,618 98,305 176.8 % Total general and administration expense $ 870,367 $ 416,853 $ 453,514 108.8 % General and administration expense increased $453.5 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870.4 million, compared to $416.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $98.3 million to $153.9 million from $55.6 million, including $23.9 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and $32.4 million in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128.1 million, related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Total investment advisory and administration fees increased $2,519.2 million to $4,360.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue increased by $140.3 million, or 63.5%, to $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519.2 million, or 136.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million, or 150.8%, to $4,010.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 along with an increase of $107.9 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction which added $589.2 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232.0 billion during 2007. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $832.2 million, or 89.0%, to $1,767.1 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375.1 million to $547.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $172.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $436.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31 2007 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $23.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 payable to PNC and other affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $78.2 million to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 169,676 $ 51,694 $ 117,982 228.2 % Marketing and promotional 169,206 100,089 69,117 69.1 % Occupancy 130,089 64,086 66,003 103.0 % Technology 117,597 61,040 56,557 92.7 % Professional services 94,282 72,740 21,542 29.6 % Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 24,008 207.2 % Other general and administration 153,923 55,618 98,305 176.8 % Total general and administration expense $ 870,367 $ 416,853 $ 453,514 108.8 % General and administration expense increased $453.5 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870.4 million, compared to $416.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $98.3 million to $153.9 million from $55.6 million, including $23.9 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and $32.4 million in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128.1 million, related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92.2 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 41 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment advisory and administration fees (continued) The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,576.7 million in equity and balanced products, $327.2 million in fixed income products, $317.2 million in cash management products and $190.3 million in alternative products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66.5 billion, $65.0 billion, $77.6 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $21.9 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Performance fees increased by $107.9 million, or 44.5%, to $350.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87.1 million to $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. Other Revenue Other revenue of $361.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $140.3 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $198.3 million, property management fees of $38.2 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27.2 million, fees related to securities lending of $27.1 million and $13.9 million for other advisory service fees. The increase in other revenue of $140.3 million, or 63.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $50.3 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services driven by new Aladdin&reg; and advisory valuation assignments, an increase of $24.6 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $20.8 million in fees earned related to securities lending, $14.6 million in fund accounting services, and $13.7 million for other advisory service fees. 38 Item 7.

Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006.

The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $98.3 million to $153.9 million from $55.6 million, including $23.9 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and $32.4 million in office related expenses.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

Total expense included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20.2 million and $141.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20.2 million of total MLIM integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45.0 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million related to general and administration, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $832.2 million, or 89.0%, to $1,767.1 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $405.7 million, $368.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively. The $405.7 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368.4 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 39 Item 7.

These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $436.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31 2007 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $23.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 payable to PNC and other affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $78.2 million to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees.

Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375.1 million to $547.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $172.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $436.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31 2007 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $23.2 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 payable to PNC and other affiliates. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $78.2 million to $108.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 169,676 $ 51,694 $ 117,982 228.2 % Marketing and promotional 169,206 100,089 69,117 69.1 % Occupancy 130,089 64,086 66,003 103.0 % Technology 117,597 61,040 56,557 92.7 % Professional services 94,282 72,740 21,542 29.6 % Closed end fund launch costs 35,594 11,586 24,008 207.2 % Other general and administration 153,923 55,618 98,305 176.8 % Total general and administration expense $ 870,367 $ 416,853 $ 453,514 108.8 % General and administration expense increased $453.5 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870.4 million, compared to $416.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 40 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $98.3 million to $153.9 million from $55.6 million, including $23.9 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and $32.4 million in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128.1 million, related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92.2 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 41 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529,055 $ 56,433 $ 472,622 NM Non controlling interest (363,615 ) (16,168 ) (347,447 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 165,440 $ 40,265 $ 125,175 310.9 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interest: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest: Private equity1 $ 64,971 $ 64 $ 64,907 NM Real estate 36,756 1,030 35,726 NM Other alternative products 30,800 7,369 23,431 NM Other2 9,859 12,353 (2,494 ) NM Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest 142,386 20,816 121,570 NM Other non controlling interest3 (2,000 ) (54 ) (1,946 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74,466 29,419 45,047 153.1 % Interest expense (49,412 ) (9,916 ) (39,496 ) 398.3 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 165,440 $ 40,265 $ 125,175 310.9 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes earnings on BlackRocks limited partnership investments in private equity funds. 2 Includes investment income related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations, deferred compensation arrangements and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 3 Includes non controlling interest related to non investment activities. Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2006.

Amount includes $27.7 billion of net new business related to MLIM in the first nine months of 2006, prior to the MLIM Transaction. 2 Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118.0 million to $169.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69.1 million, or 69.1%, to $169.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $84.8 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $15.7 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130.1 million, representing a $66.0 million, or 103.0%, increase from $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $56.6 million, or 92.7%, to $117.6 million compared to $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13.0 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19.4 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $14.7 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11.6 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21.5 million, or 29.6%, to $94.3 million compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $98.3 million to $153.9 million from $55.6 million, including $23.9 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and $32.4 million in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128.1 million, related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92.2 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 41 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $125.2 million to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121.6 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, and a $45.0 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39.5 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14.2 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense was $463.8 million and $189.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51.4 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that will reduce corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Absent this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 35.3%. Net Income Net income totaled $995.3 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82.0 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34.3 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $12.9 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and $6.4 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51.4 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM and Quellos integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $322.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $31.5 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89.4 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1.2 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53.3%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating Margin The Companys operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes the impacts of $128.1 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $41.6 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20.7 million of integration costs. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes the impact of $15.0 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $141.9 million of integration costs. Including the impact of a $92 million increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the MLIM and Quellos acquisitions, operating margin improved 4.2% primarily due to the reduction of integration costs as well as operating leverage associated with the growth in revenue, partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing agreements. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2006.

Amount includes $27.7 billion of net new business related to MLIM in the first nine months of 2006, prior to the MLIM Transaction. 2 Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the MLIM Transaction, subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $906.6 million, or 76.1%, to $2,098.0 million, compared with $1,191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Investment advisory and administration fees increased $822.7 million to $1,841.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $1,018.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Other revenue increased by $59.4 million, or 36.7%, to $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Investment advisory and administration fees The increase in total investment advisory and administration fees of $822.7 million, or 80.8%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million, or 88.0%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 along with an increase of $74.3 million in performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased AUM of $671.9 billion, including $589.2 billion of AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $748.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of increases of $449.1 million in equity and balanced products, $136.5 million in fixed income products, $97.1 million in cash management products and $65.7 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration fees for equity and balanced, fixed income, cash management and alternative investment products was driven by increases in AUM of $355.4 billion, $149.6 billion, $144.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which included the AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006. Performance fees increased by $74.3 million, or 44.2%, to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to fees earned on a large institutional real estate client account and the Companys other alternative products. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $24.6 million to $35.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in distribution fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in the third quarter 2006. Other Revenue Other revenue of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $59.4 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 and primarily represents fees earned on BlackRock Solutions products and services of $148.0 million, property management fees of $32.1 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Realty employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $12.6 million and fees related to securities lending of $6.3 million. The increase in other revenue of $59.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of an increase of $24.4 million from BlackRock Solutions products and services primarily driven by new Aladdin assignments, and increases of $12.6 million in fund accounting services and $6.3 million in fees earned related to securities lending. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 934,887 $ 587,773 $ 347,114 59.1 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 172,531 64,611 107,920 167.0 % Amortization of deferred sales commissions 29,940 9,346 20,594 220.3 % General and administration 416,853 181,610 235,243 129.5 % Fee sharing payment 34,450 34,450 NM Amortization of intangible assets 37,515 7,505 30,010 399.9 % Total expenses $ 1,626,176 $ 850,845 $ 775,331 91.1 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflects the impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006 and includes $141.9 million of integration charges, increased $775.3 million, or 91.1%, to $1,626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $850.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

The increase was attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expense, a fee sharing payment, and amortization of intangible assets. Integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction included $45.0 million in employee compensation and benefits and $96.9 million in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased by $347.1 million, or 59.1%, to $934.9 million, at December 31, 2006 compared to $587.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits and incentive compensation of $193.6 million and $142.8 million, respectively. The $193.6 million, increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with business growth and the MLIM Transaction. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2006 totaled 5,113 as compared to 2,148 at December 31, 2005. The $142.8 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to growth in operating income and higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products and $45.0 million of MLIM integration costs. Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $107.9 million to $172.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to third parties, including Merrill Lynch and PNC, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs included $96.4 million of expense in the fourth quarter 2006 payable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $24.1 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 payable to PNC and affiliates. 46 Item 7.

The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Expenses (continued) Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased by $20.6 million to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions is primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM. General and Administration Expense Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 51,694 $ 14,046 $ 37,648 268.0 % Marketing and promotional 100,089 37,565 62,524 166.4 % Occupancy 64,086 36,190 27,896 77.1 % Technology 61,040 22,662 38,378 169.3 % Professional services 72,740 18,360 54,380 296.2 % Closed end fund launch costs 11,586 13,259 (1,673 ) (12.6 )% Other general and administration 55,618 39,528 16,090 40.7 % Total general and administration expense $ 416,853 $ 181,610 $ 235,243 129.5 % General and administration expense increased $235.2 million, or 129.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $416.9 million, compared to $181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in general and administration expense was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expense of $62.5 million, professional services of $54.4 million, technology expense of $38.4 million, portfolio services expense of $37.6 million, occupancy expense of $27.9 million and other general and administration expense of $16.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in closed end fund launch costs of $1.7 million. The increase in general and administration expense included $96.9 million of integration costs primarily related to marketing and promotional and professional services in connection with the MLIM Transaction. 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7.

Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) General and Administration (continued) Marketing and promotional expense increased $62.5 million, or 166.4%, to $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $29.6 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts and $32.9 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign. Professional services expenses increased $54.4 million, or 296.2%, to $72.7 million compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the MLIM Transaction. Technology expenses increased $38.4 million, to $61.0 million compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the integration of the MLIM business. Portfolio services increased by $37.6 million to $51.7 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities of the combined Company. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $64.1 million, representing a $27.9 million, increase from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and business growth. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $13.3 million relating to four new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.1 billion in AUM. Other general and administration costs increased by $16.1 million to $55.6 million from $39.5 million, as a result of increased operating growth and the MLIM Transaction. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34.5 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSRM Holdings, Inc. acquisition in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $30.0 million increase in amortization of intangible assets to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM Transaction. Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Total non operating income $ 56,433 $ 35,214 $ 21,219 60.3 % Non controlling interest (16,168 ) (3,289 ) (12,879 ) 391.6 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest (continued) The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interest: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interest: Private equity1 $ 64 $ $ 64 NM Real estate 1,030 2,303 (1,273 ) (55.3 )% Other alternative products 7,369 13,904 (6,535 ) (47.0 )% Other2 12,353 7,515 4,838 64.4 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest 20,816 23,722 (2,906 ) (12.3 )% Other non controlling interest3 (54 ) (2,785 ) 2,731 (98.1 )% Interest and dividend income 29,419 18,912 10,507 55.6 % Interest expense (9,916 ) (7,924 ) (1,992 ) 25.1 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes earnings on BlackRocks limited partnership investments in private equity funds. 2 Includes investment income related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations, deferred compensation arrangements and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 3 Includes non controlling interest related to non investment activities. Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interest (continued) The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interest, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interest: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interest: Private equity1 $ 64 $ $ 64 NM Real estate 1,030 2,303 (1,273 ) (55.3 )% Other alternative products 7,369 13,904 (6,535 ) (47.0 )% Other2 12,353 7,515 4,838 64.4 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest 20,816 23,722 (2,906 ) (12.3 )% Other non controlling interest3 (54 ) (2,785 ) 2,731 (98.1 )% Interest and dividend income 29,419 18,912 10,507 55.6 % Interest expense (9,916 ) (7,924 ) (1,992 ) 25.1 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interest $ 40,265 $ 31,925 $ 8,340 26.1 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes earnings on BlackRocks limited partnership investments in private equity funds. 2 Includes investment income related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations, deferred compensation arrangements and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 3 Includes non controlling interest related to non investment activities. Non operating income, net of non controlling interest, increased $8.3 million to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $10.5 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to interest owed to Merrill Lynch on certain liabilities assumed in the MLIM Transaction and a $2.9 million decrease in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest. The decrease in the net gain on investments, net of non controlling interest, was primarily due to a decrease in net investment gains on seed investments in real estate and other alternative products, partially offset by significant growth of the Companys investments in sponsored investment products. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $189.5 million and $138.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, representing effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.2%, respectively. 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2005 (continued) Net Income Net income totaled $322.6 million, or $3.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 an increase of $88.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of integration costs related to the MLIM Transaction, the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees, of $89.4 million, $31.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $233.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 included the after tax impacts of the portion of LTIP awards funded by a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC and SSR integration costs of $30.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively. SSR integration costs included acquisition related payments to continuing employees of BlackRock and professional fees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.30, or 32.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Other Operating Items Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2007, BlackRock managed approximately $313 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During the third and fourth quarters, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including those issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles, held by these two funds. During 2007 BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $89 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions totaling $24 million during 2007 to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. The capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense of $24 million for 2007. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock has agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. The terms of the capital support agreements expire in December 2008 unless renewed by BlackRock. In addition, due to continuing market illiquidity, BlackRock suspended cash redemptions from these two funds in December 2007. As of February 2008, subsequent to the suspension of cash redemptions, the funds distributed approximately $930 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. In addition, BlackRock recorded $12 million in general and administration expense in the fourth quarter and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2007 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on its difference from fair value. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Other Operating Items (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FIN 46(R)) these two funds meet the definition of variable interest entities. In applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) the Company applies an expected loss model to the funds to determine the primary beneficiary of the funds. As a result of the application of the model, BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of either fund. The Company will perform the expected loss model calculation quarterly to determine whether BlackRock is the primary beneficiary. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock manages various collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities, through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. Typically, BlackRocks role is as collateral manager. The Company also may invest in a percentage of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs in its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks carrying value on the statement of financial condition, of investments in these CDOs was approximately $10.5 million, of which approximately $9.3 million was in CDOs backed by leveraged finance assets and approximately $1.2 million backed by structured finance securities. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $16.7 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. Under the terms of its credit default swap, the Company is entitled to an annual coupon of 4% of the swaps notional balance of $16.7 million and 25% of the structures residual balance at its expected termination date of December 23, 2009. Management has performed an assessment of the Companys variable interest under FIN 46(R) and has concluded the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the CDO transaction. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $4.9 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other assets. At December 31, 2007, BlackRocks maximum risk of loss related to CDOs was approximately $32.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. At December 31, 2007, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated statements of financial condition of $1,656.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents, net of amounts in consolidated sponsored investment funds of $67.0 million and net of regulatory capital requirements ($217.4 million, partially met with cash and cash equivalents) was $1,371.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the Company had committed access to $2,100 million of undrawn cash via its 2007 five year credit facility, resulting in cash, net of cash in consolidated sponsored investment funds and regulatory capital requirements, plus credit capacity of $3,471.8 million. Approximately $67.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,054.2 million in investments included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007 are held by sponsored investment funds that are consolidated by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP. The Company may not be able to access such cash or investments to use in its operating activities. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, are not readily convertible to cash. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions products and services, property management fees, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on certain of the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its operating cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. Investment Activities At December 31, 2007, the Company had $513.9 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds and unfunded commitments related to one private equity warehouse facility. Generally, the timing of the funding of capital commitments is uncertain and such commitments could expire before funding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to seed additional investment products for and with clients. At December 31, 2007, the Company had loaned approximately $79.5 million to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. At December 31, 2007, the Company had committed to make additional loans of approximately $89.6 million under the agreements. The Company anticipates making additional commitments under these facilities from time to time, but is not obligated to do so. Borrowings In December 2006, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banking institutions. This facility, as amended in February 2007 (the 2006 facility), permitted the Company to borrow up to $800 million. In August 2007, the Company terminated the 2006 facility and entered into a new five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3.0 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied at December 31, 2007. The 2007 facility was used to refinance the 2006 facility and will provide back up liquidity, fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and fund investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008 in addition to the $100 million of letters of credit outstanding related to the capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2007, long term borrowings were $947.0 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the convertible debentures (discussed later) are repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, are $51.0 million in 2008 and 2009, $297.7 million in 2010 and $43.8 million in 2011 and 2012. 52 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Capital Activities In June 2007, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which it would acquire certain assets of the fund of funds business of Quellos for up to $1.719 billion. This transaction closed on October 1, 2007, and BlackRock paid Quellos $562.5 million in cash and $187.5 million in BlackRock common stock. The common stock will be held in escrow for up to three years and is available to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of Quellos under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, Quellos may receive up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock contingent upon achieving certain operating measures through December 31, 2010. On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2007. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. In 2007, under the terms of the 2002 LTIP Awards, employees elected to put approximately 95% of the stock portion of the awards back to BlackRock at a total fair market value of approximately $166 million. During 2007, BlackRock paid cash dividends of $353.5 million, or 35.5% of its net income. BlackRock announced an increase to the quarterly dividend rate, effective with the March 24, 2008 payment, to $0.78 per share from $0.67 per share paid in 2007. Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfer of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2007, the Company was required to maintain approximately $217.4 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2007: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 43,750 $ 918,750 $ 1,137,500 Convertible debentures 6,563 6,563 253,278 266,404 Other 684 684 684 2,052 Short term borrowings1 309,086 309,086 Operating leases 71,696 65,463 62,919 60,576 54,944 216,982 532,580 Purchase obligations 48,310 32,270 14,180 9,537 6,164 110,461 Investment / loan commitments 98,795 89,642 49,548 643 364,927 603,555 Total contractual obligations and commitments 578,884 238,372 424,359 114,506 104,858 1,500,659 2,961,638 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 409,363 307,022 716,385 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 295,000 10,000 595,000 900,000 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 988,247 $ 840,394 $ 434,359 $ 709,506 $ 104,858 $ 1,500,659 $ 4,578,023 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $61.8 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $100 million related to capital support agreements for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Notes In September 2007, the Company issued $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $5.6 million, which is being amortized over their ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.6 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. On the contractual obligations table above, the principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed to be repaid at BlackRocks option in 2010, and the related interest has been included through the call date. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures may be converted at the option of the holders. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2007, the Company had $300.0 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with interest rates between 5.105% to 5.315% and maturity dates between March 2008 and September 2008. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2007, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments The Company has various capital commitments to fund companies or investment funds in which it has an ownership stake as well as loan commitments to certain funds of funds managed by the Company and warehouse entities established for such funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2007. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. BlackRock is also obligated to maintain specified ownership levels in certain investment products, which may result in additional required contributions or distributions of capital. These amounts are inherently uncertain and have been excluded from the contractual obligations schedule above. In addition, as a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into a global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until September 30, 2009. After such term, the agreement will renew for additional one year terms, subject to certain conditions. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc., and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2007 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265.1 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10.0 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory revenue measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. The second contingent payment of up to $595 million is payable in cash. At December 31, 2007, the Company believes it is likely that the first contingent payment will be paid in full, however the ultimate outcome is not certain. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and benefit obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2007 totaled $1,086.6 million and included incentive compensation of $834.6 million, deferred compensation of $133.0 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $119.0 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2008, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $4.7 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2007. See further discussion in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on F 1 of this Form 10 K. 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment.

There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary.

Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7.

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has on its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if BlackRock has a 50% or greater voting interest, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. For certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, with its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. The Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non related party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds. In December 2007, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at December 31, 2007 of approximately $1 billion. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2007. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value of Investments BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had approximately $2.0 billion in investments. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.736 billion of such investments will impact the Companys consolidated statements of income and approximately $264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact BlackRocks investment income and non controlling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is $325 million. Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income, based upon the most currently available information, is recorded as non operating income. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $554.0 million and $326.5 million, respectively, of equity method investees reflected within investments. 59 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future. Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in thousands) December 31,2007 Goodwill $ 5,519,714 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,351,132 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,201,990 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 12,072,836 60 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2007, ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 8.7 years. The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering factors such as AUM, product mix, projected cash flows, average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. If such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. No such impairments were recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $129.7 million, $37.5 million and 7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses impairment on its investments. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. There were no impairments of investments, other than CDOs (see below), for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. CDO impairments were $16.4 million, $2.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income.

Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $47.1 million and current income taxes payable of $228.4 million at December 31, 2007. Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $780.4 million and $156.0 million, respectively. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, performance fee revenue totaled $350.2 million, $242.3 million and $168.0 million, respectively. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $28.6 million and $0, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. Management can give no assurance, however, that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future.

Recent Accounting Developments Recent accounting developments are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 63 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments over prescribed thresholds receive prior approval from the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2007, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees: the value of AUM to decrease; the returns realized on AUM to decrease; clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve; clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that BlackRock does not manage; and clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $94 million. At December 31, 2007, approximately $1,054 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. The Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2007 December 31,2006 Total investments $ 2,000 $ 2,098 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (1,054 ) (1,470 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 325 325 Total net economic investment exposure $ 1,271 $ 953 64 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Equity Market Price Risk At December 31, 2007, the Companys net exposure to equity price risk is approximately $835 million (net of $94 million of certain equity investments that are hedged via total return swaps) of the Companys net economic investment exposure. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in equity prices would result in a decrease of approximately $83.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk as a result of approximately $342 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $5.1 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $93 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $9.3 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock had $66.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $40.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. Such changes in circumstance would cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $9.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit.
