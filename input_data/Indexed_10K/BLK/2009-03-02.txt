MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.307 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2008. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions&reg; provides market risk management, financial strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workouts, risk management and strategic planning and execution. Severe market dislocations continued in 2008, with a broad range of markets delivering sharply negative returns. Such conditions continue to challenge investors worldwide, many of which have withdrawn from long dated markets in favor of safe havens, such as money markets, deposits and U.S. Treasuries. The deterioration in net asset values adversely affected investors and investment managers. AUM ended the year at $1.307 trillion, down 4% since December 31, 2007. For the year, net new business totaled $167.6 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate, which was overwhelmed by a $217.1 billion decline in asset values due to the severe fall in markets and U.S. dollar strengthening. During the last twelve months, we were awarded net inflows of $135.0 billion from U.S. investors and $32.6 billion from international investors. BlackRock Solutions had exceptionally robust results, adding 72 assignments during the year and completing 46 short term mandates. For the year, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue exceeded $400 million, more than doubling the amount earned in 2007. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRocks common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2008, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 44.2% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 48.2% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 36.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 32.1% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) acquired Merrill Lynch. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and PNC pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of the BlackRock voting common stock they hold for non voting preferred stock. Following the closing of these exchanges on February 27, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC owned approximately 4.9% and 46.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock, respectively. The capital stock held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC in BlackRock remained largely unchanged at approximately 47.4% and 31.5% on a fully diluted basis, respectively. 33 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,593 $ 1,294 $ 472 Non GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charges 38 PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 54 50 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 2 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 20 142 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 8 Operating income, as adjusted 1,662 1,518 674 Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 11 Closed end fund launch commissions 6 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,671 $ 1,560 $ 688 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 2,098 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (598 ) (548 ) (173 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (130 ) (108 ) (30 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (21 ) (27 ) (22 ) Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, measurement $ 4,315 $ 4,162 $ 1,873 Operating margin, GAAP basis 31.4 % 26.7 % 22.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.7 % 37.5 % 36.7 % 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7.

Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7.

These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward looking Statements This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRocks future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as trend, potential, opportunity, pipeline, believe, comfortable, expect, anticipate, current, intention, estimate, position, assume, outlook, continue, remain, maintain, sustain, seek, achieve, and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, may or similar expressions. BlackRock cautions that forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. In addition to risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRocks SEC reports and those identified elsewhere in this report the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management; (3) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRocks investment products; (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of capital improvement projects; (6) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (7) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (8) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (9) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection; (10) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch or PNC; (11) terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (12) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (13) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRocks investments; (14) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the value of investment advisory and administration fees earned by BlackRock or the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies; (15) the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (16) the ability of BlackRock to effectively manage the former Quellos business along with its historical operations; (17) BlackRocks success in maintaining the distribution of its products; (18) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time; and (19) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions. 32 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.307 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2008. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions&reg; provides market risk management, financial strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workouts, risk management and strategic planning and execution. Severe market dislocations continued in 2008, with a broad range of markets delivering sharply negative returns. Such conditions continue to challenge investors worldwide, many of which have withdrawn from long dated markets in favor of safe havens, such as money markets, deposits and U.S. Treasuries. The deterioration in net asset values adversely affected investors and investment managers. AUM ended the year at $1.307 trillion, down 4% since December 31, 2007. For the year, net new business totaled $167.6 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate, which was overwhelmed by a $217.1 billion decline in asset values due to the severe fall in markets and U.S. dollar strengthening. During the last twelve months, we were awarded net inflows of $135.0 billion from U.S. investors and $32.6 billion from international investors. BlackRock Solutions had exceptionally robust results, adding 72 assignments during the year and completing 46 short term mandates. For the year, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue exceeded $400 million, more than doubling the amount earned in 2007. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRocks common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2008, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 44.2% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 48.2% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 36.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 32.1% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) acquired Merrill Lynch. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and PNC pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of the BlackRock voting common stock they hold for non voting preferred stock. Following the closing of these exchanges on February 27, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC owned approximately 4.9% and 46.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock, respectively. The capital stock held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC in BlackRock remained largely unchanged at approximately 47.4% and 31.5% on a fully diluted basis, respectively. 33 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7.

These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Total non operating income (expense) $ (574 ) $ 529 $ (1,103 ) (208 )% Non controlling interests (155 ) 364 (519 ) 143 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests $ (419 ) $ 165 $ (584 ) (353 )% The components of non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ (28 ) $ 65 $ (93 ) (144 )% Real estate (127 ) 34 (161 ) (475 )% Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (194 ) 23 (217 ) NM Investments related to deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 (50 ) (419 )% Other investments1 (30 ) 8 (38 ) (441 )% Total net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests (417 ) 142 (559 ) (393 )% Interest and dividend income 65 74 (9 ) (13 )% Interest expense (66 ) (49 ) (17 ) 33 % Other non controlling interest2 (1 ) (2 ) 1 67 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (584 ) (353 )% Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) 50 419 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ (534 ) (348 )% NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock or the Company) is one of the largest publicly traded investment management firms in the United States with $1.307 trillion of assets under management (AUM) at December 31, 2008. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of fixed income, cash management, equity and balanced and alternative investment separate accounts and funds. In addition, BlackRock Solutions&reg; provides market risk management, financial strategic advisory and enterprise investment system services to a broad base of clients. Financial markets advisory services include valuation of illiquid securities, dispositions and workouts, risk management and strategic planning and execution. Severe market dislocations continued in 2008, with a broad range of markets delivering sharply negative returns. Such conditions continue to challenge investors worldwide, many of which have withdrawn from long dated markets in favor of safe havens, such as money markets, deposits and U.S. Treasuries. The deterioration in net asset values adversely affected investors and investment managers. AUM ended the year at $1.307 trillion, down 4% since December 31, 2007. For the year, net new business totaled $167.6 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate, which was overwhelmed by a $217.1 billion decline in asset values due to the severe fall in markets and U.S. dollar strengthening. During the last twelve months, we were awarded net inflows of $135.0 billion from U.S. investors and $32.6 billion from international investors. BlackRock Solutions had exceptionally robust results, adding 72 assignments during the year and completing 46 short term mandates. For the year, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue exceeded $400 million, more than doubling the amount earned in 2007. On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (Merrill Lynch) contributed the entities and assets that constituted its investment management business, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), to BlackRock in exchange for common and non voting preferred stock such that immediately after such closing Merrill Lynch held approximately 45% of BlackRocks common stock outstanding and approximately 49.3% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis (the MLIM Transaction). On October 1, 2007, BlackRock acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (Quellos) for up to $1.719 billion in a combination of cash and common stock (the Quellos Transaction). At December 31, 2008, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 44.2% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 48.2% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) owned approximately 36.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock outstanding and approximately 32.1% of the Companys capital stock on a fully diluted basis. On January 1, 2009, Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) acquired Merrill Lynch. In connection with this transaction, BlackRock entered into exchange agreements with each of Merrill Lynch and PNC pursuant to which each agreed to exchange a portion of the BlackRock voting common stock they hold for non voting preferred stock. Following the closing of these exchanges on February 27, 2009, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC owned approximately 4.9% and 46.5% of BlackRocks voting common stock, respectively. The capital stock held by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and PNC in BlackRock remained largely unchanged at approximately 47.4% and 31.5% on a fully diluted basis, respectively. 33 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,593 $ 1,294 $ 472 Non GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charges 38 PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 54 50 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 2 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 20 142 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 8 Operating income, as adjusted 1,662 1,518 674 Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 11 Closed end fund launch commissions 6 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,671 $ 1,560 $ 688 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 2,098 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (598 ) (548 ) (173 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (130 ) (108 ) (30 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (21 ) (27 ) (22 ) Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, measurement $ 4,315 $ 4,162 $ 1,873 Operating margin, GAAP basis 31.4 % 26.7 % 22.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.7 % 37.5 % 36.7 % 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Total non operating income (expense) $ (574 ) $ 529 $ (1,103 ) (208 )% Non controlling interests (155 ) 364 (519 ) 143 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests $ (419 ) $ 165 $ (584 ) (353 )% The components of non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ (28 ) $ 65 $ (93 ) (144 )% Real estate (127 ) 34 (161 ) (475 )% Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (194 ) 23 (217 ) NM Investments related to deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 (50 ) (419 )% Other investments1 (30 ) 8 (38 ) (441 )% Total net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests (417 ) 142 (559 ) (393 )% Interest and dividend income 65 74 (9 ) (13 )% Interest expense (66 ) (49 ) (17 ) 33 % Other non controlling interest2 (1 ) (2 ) 1 67 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (584 ) (353 )% Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) 50 419 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ (534 ) (348 )% NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,593 $ 1,294 $ 472 Non GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charges 38 PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 54 50 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 2 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 20 142 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 8 Operating income, as adjusted 1,662 1,518 674 Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 11 Closed end fund launch commissions 6 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,671 $ 1,560 $ 688 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 2,098 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (598 ) (548 ) (173 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (130 ) (108 ) (30 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (21 ) (27 ) (22 ) Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, measurement $ 4,315 $ 4,162 $ 1,873 Operating margin, GAAP basis 31.4 % 26.7 % 22.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.7 % 37.5 % 36.7 % 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock reports its financial results on a GAAP basis; however, management believes that evaluating the Companys ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior period non GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 1,593 $ 1,294 $ 472 Non GAAP adjustments: Restructuring charges 38 PNC LTIP funding obligation 59 54 50 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 2 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 20 142 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 Compensation expense related to (depreciation) appreciation on deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 8 Operating income, as adjusted 1,662 1,518 674 Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 11 Closed end fund launch commissions 6 3 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 1,671 $ 1,560 $ 688 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 2,098 Non GAAP adjustments: Portfolio administration and servicing costs (598 ) (548 ) (173 ) Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions (130 ) (108 ) (30 ) Reimbursable property management compensation (21 ) (27 ) (22 ) Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, measurement $ 4,315 $ 4,162 $ 1,873 Operating margin, GAAP basis 31.4 % 26.7 % 22.5 % Operating margin, as adjusted 38.7 % 37.5 % 36.7 % 35 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (a) (continued) Management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks performance over time. As such, management believes that operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, provide useful disclosure to investors. Operating income, as adjusted: Restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees. MLIM and Quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees, rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations. The expenses associated with: (i) the 2008 restructuring, (ii) MLIM and Quellos integration costs and (iii) the 2007 termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods. As such, management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance for the respective periods. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the Company receives offsetting revenue for these services. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (Metric), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (Realty). These employees were retained on Metrics payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realtys clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realtys clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they bear no economic cost to BlackRock. 36 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, net of non controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation (appreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (574 ) $ 529 $ 56 Non controlling interests, GAAP basis (155 ) 364 16 Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 40 Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) (8 ) Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ 32 Management believes that non operating income (expense), as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7.

The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

As compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted, provides useful measures to investors of BlackRocks non operating results. 37 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value.

The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7.

The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock, Inc. Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income, as adjusted: Management believes that net income, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income, as adjusted, equals net income, GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items as well as charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value. Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income, GAAP basis $ 786 $ 995 $ 323 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) Restructuring charges 26 PNCs LTIP funding obligation 39 34 32 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 6 1 MLIM/Quellos integration costs 13 89 Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 82 Corporate deferred income tax rate changes (51 ) Net income, as adjusted $ 858 $ 1,079 $ 445 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (e) 132,996,426 132,088,810 83,358,394 Diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis (e) $ 5.91 $ 7.53 $ 3.87 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (e) $ 6.45 $ 8.17 $ 5.33 The restructuring charges and the MLIM and Quellos integration costs reflected in GAAP net income have been deemed non recurring by management and have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods. The portion of the compensation expense associated with LTIP awards that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and the anticipated Merrill Lynch compensation contribution have been excluded from net income, as adjusted, because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRocks book value. The termination of the closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as the termination of the arrangements is deemed non recurring by management. During third quarter 2007, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income taxes, effective in April and January of 2008, respectively, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. The resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income, as adjusted, as it is non recurring and to ensure comparability to current reporting periods. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2008, non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 33%, BlackRocks 2008 effective tax rate. Non GAAP adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2007, were tax effected at 36%, which approximated BlackRocks 2007 effective tax rate after adjusting primarily for the impact of the United Kingdom and Germany corporate income tax rate reductions. (e) Series A non voting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of earnings per share calculations. 38 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The Company manages a wide array of taxable and tax exempt fixed income, equity and balanced mutual funds and separate accounts, as well as a wide assortment of index based equity and alternative investment products for a diverse global clientele. BlackRock provides global advisory services for mutual funds and other non U.S. equivalent retail products. The Companys non U.S. mutual funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including cash management, fixed income and equities. The Merrill Lynch International Investment Funds, the primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, were rebranded in April 2008 as the BlackRock Global Funds. The BlackRock Global Funds are authorized for distribution in more than 37 jurisdictions worldwide. In the United States, the primary retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension funds, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to retail and institutional investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, which, following Bank of Americas acquisition of Merrill Lynch, runs through January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. See Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration base fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM, percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain products, or, in the case of certain real estate equity separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange gains or losses and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and BlackRocks alternative investment products provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time or when investment performance exceeds certain contractual thresholds. As such, the timing of the recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic, investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services relating to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing for clients. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. 39 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7.

The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview (continued) Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries, deferred and incentive compensation, stock based compensation and related benefit costs. Portfolio administration and servicing costs include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under the global distribution agreement and to PNC affiliated entities, as well as to third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. BlackRock holds investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Non operating income (expense) includes the impact of the change in the valuations of these investments. Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM. AUM decreased approximately $49 billion, or 4%, to $1.307 trillion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.357 trillion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM was attributable to $189 billion in net market depreciation and $28 billion in net foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $168 billion in net subscriptions. BlackRock, Inc.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7.

The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Assets Under Management (continued) Market depreciation of $189 billion was primarily due to depreciation in equity and balanced AUM of $160 billion, as equity markets declined during the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation on fixed income products of $17 billion and alternative investment products of $13 billion. The $28 billion reduction in AUM from foreign exchange was across all asset classes due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar which resulted in foreign exchange translation loss from converting non dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars. Net subscriptions of $168 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to net new business of $145 billion in long term advisory liquidation assignments, $26 billion in cash management products and $3 billion in alternative investment products, partially offset by $7 billion of net outflows in fixed income products. The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. BlackRock, Inc.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7.

Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7.

Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction.

As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

Business Outlook As fiscal 2009 began, domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy. Illiquid capital markets, lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes. The U.S. housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns, and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud (in which none of BlackRocks funds of funds were invested) have contributed to investors, industry wide, seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers. The timing and direction of volatile markets, investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the Company recognizes. The direction of markets, particularly real estate and private equity, will also affect the valuation of the assets on the Companys balance sheet. The Company notes that the global recession, declining asset values, the liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have impacted our business, including the value and mix of AUM and associated base fees. AUM and base fees may be affected by further market changes during the remainder of 2009. The build up of institutional liquidity assets experienced since the fourth quarter of 2007 may be temporary, as these assets are expected to be redeployed to longer dated strategies as market conditions stabilize. The Companys strategic focus on performance, globalization and product diversification, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. 42 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Business Outlook (continued) The liquidity crunch and associated market disruption have given rise to greater demand for our advisory services, marrying our extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities. While we anticipate demand for these services to remain high through the volatile markets, demand may return to historical levels should market concerns ease. A meaningful percentage of BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues in 2008 was composed of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees. Because this type of revenue is non recurring, it is dependent on new assignments which may or may not continue, particularly at the same pace. Alternative investment products with performance fee hurdles based on absolute performance measures and high water marks may not contribute performance fee revenue at levels that the Company has earned in prior periods. The value of the Companys co investments in alternative products may continue to decline as the underlying value in certain assets classes, particularly real estate and private equity, continue to decline. In early 2009, returns on many major equity indices have continued to decline from year end 2008, which may impact the Companys revenue in future periods. The Company will continue to assess the appropriateness of its cost structure relative to the external environment. The Company may decide to take additional measures to reduce costs. While any measure would be expected to lower the cost base over time, certain measures may or may not have upfront implementation costs. Given the severity of the market driven revenue impacts mentioned above, the operating margins of the Company would be expected to decline, even in the face of cost saving measures. There may be certain circumstances in which the Company may consider temporarily waiving fees on certain products. If these circumstances were to occur and fee waivers were to be granted, the revenues of the Company would be adversely affected. The effective tax rate of the Company is affected, among other things, by the geographic distribution of earnings and global changes in tax legislation. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period as a result of these factors. 43 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 Revenue Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Investment advisory and administration fees: Fixed income $ 892 $ 901 $ (9 ) (1 )% Equity and balanced 2,101 2,218 (117 ) (5 )% Cash management 708 520 188 36 % Alternative investment products 531 371 160 43 % Investment advisory and administration base fees 4,232 4,010 222 6 % Fixed income 4 4 0 % Equity and balanced 95 107 (12 ) (11 )% Alternative investment products 78 239 (161 ) (67 )% Investment advisory performance fees 177 350 (173 ) (49 )% Total investment advisory and administration fees 4,409 4,360 49 1 % BlackRock Solutions and advisory 406 198 208 105 % Distribution fees 139 123 16 13 % Other revenue 110 164 (54 ) (32 )% Total revenue $ 5,064 $ 4,845 $ 219 5 % Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $219 million, or 5%, to $5,064 million, compared with $4,845 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $219 million increase was primarily the result of a $208 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue and a $49 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $49 million, or 1%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million, or 6%, to $4,232 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by a decrease of $173 million in investment advisory performance fees. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of increases in base fees of $188 million in cash management products and $160 million in alternative investment products, partially offset by decreases of $117 million in equity and balanced products and $9 million in fixed income products. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of increased average AUM in 2008 compared to 2007 for cash management products due to net subscriptions and alternative investment products due to the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction, offset by lower fees in equity and balanced products due to the impact of market depreciation on AUM. 44 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory and Administration Fees (continued) Investment advisory performance fees decreased by $173 million, or 49%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of lower investment advisory performance fees earned on other alternative investment products, including real estate funds, fixed income hedge funds and international equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $208 million, or 105%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory assignments and Aladdin&reg; assignments during the period. A portion of the revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $16 million to $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements, as well as an increase in contingent deferred sales commissions as a result of redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. Other Revenue Other revenue of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $54 million, or 32%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other revenue represents property management fees of $31 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), $25 million of net interest related to securities lending, $23 million of unit trust sales commissions and $31 million of other revenue, including fund accounting services. The decrease in other revenue of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily the result of a decrease in fees earned for fund accounting services of $16 million, a $14 million decline in other advisory service fees earned in 2007, a $12 million decline in unit trust sales commissions and a $7 million decline in property management fees primarily related to the termination in the fourth quarter of 2008 of certain Metric contracts with BlackRock real estate clients. Certain Metric employees have been transferred to a third party, which will provide to real estate clients the property management services formerly provided by Metric. At December 31, 2008, Metric had no remaining employees. 45 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 171 $ 170 $ 1 1 % Marketing and promotional 156 169 (13 ) (8 )% Occupancy 138 130 8 6 % Technology 116 118 (2 ) (1 )% Professional services 77 94 (17 ) (18 )% Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 (27 ) (74 )% Other general and administration 78 153 (75 ) (50 )% Total general and administration expense $ 745 $ 870 $ (125 ) (14 )% 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Total non operating income (expense) $ (574 ) $ 529 $ (1,103 ) (208 )% Non controlling interests (155 ) 364 (519 ) 143 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests $ (419 ) $ 165 $ (584 ) (353 )% The components of non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ (28 ) $ 65 $ (93 ) (144 )% Real estate (127 ) 34 (161 ) (475 )% Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (194 ) 23 (217 ) NM Investments related to deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 (50 ) (419 )% Other investments1 (30 ) 8 (38 ) (441 )% Total net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests (417 ) 142 (559 ) (393 )% Interest and dividend income 65 74 (9 ) (13 )% Interest expense (66 ) (49 ) (17 ) 33 % Other non controlling interest2 (1 ) (2 ) 1 67 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (584 ) (353 )% Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) 50 419 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ (534 ) (348 )% NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7.

Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7.

Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction.

As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2008 2007 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,815 $ 1,767 $ 48 3 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 597 548 49 9 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 130 108 22 20 % General and administration 745 870 (125 ) (14 )% Restructuring charges 38 38 NM Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 (128 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 146 130 16 12 % Total expenses $ 3,471 $ 3,551 $ (80 ) (2 )% NM Not Meaningful Total expenses decreased $80 million, or 2%, to $3,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements in 2007 and a $125 million decrease in general and administration expenses, partially offset by increases in portfolio administration and servicing costs, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring charges, amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions, and amortization of intangible assets. The year ended December 31, 2007, included $20 million of MLIM and Quellos integration costs, which were primarily recorded in general and administration expense. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $48 million, or 3%, to $1,815 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $1,767 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits offset by a $38 million decrease in deferred compensation which is primarily linked to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The increase of $91 million in salaries and benefits was primarily due to an increase in headcount throughout the majority of 2007 and 2008 (including the impact associated with the fund of funds acquisition in 2007). Full time employees at December 31, 2008 totaled 5,341 (including the impact of a reduction in force in the fourth quarter) as compared to 5,952 (including Metric) at December 31, 2007. The decline in deferred compensation of $38 million is substantially offset by the change in valuations of investments set aside for these plans, which are included in non operating income (expense). 46 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $49 million, or 9%, to $597 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $49 million increase related primarily to higher levels of average AUM in cash management products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $464 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $30 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $444 million and $28 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs attributable to Merrill Lynch is offset by approximately $10 million expense reduction associated with the 2007 termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related third parties increased $30 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $22 million to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from PNC in second quarter 2007 as well as higher sales and redemptions in certain share classes of open ended funds. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 171 $ 170 $ 1 1 % Marketing and promotional 156 169 (13 ) (8 )% Occupancy 138 130 8 6 % Technology 116 118 (2 ) (1 )% Professional services 77 94 (17 ) (18 )% Closed end fund launch costs 9 36 (27 ) (74 )% Other general and administration 78 153 (75 ) (50 )% Total general and administration expense $ 745 $ 870 $ (125 ) (14 )% 47 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Total non operating income (expense) $ (574 ) $ 529 $ (1,103 ) (208 )% Non controlling interests (155 ) 364 (519 ) 143 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests $ (419 ) $ 165 $ (584 ) (353 )% The components of non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ (28 ) $ 65 $ (93 ) (144 )% Real estate (127 ) 34 (161 ) (475 )% Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (194 ) 23 (217 ) NM Investments related to deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 (50 ) (419 )% Other investments1 (30 ) 8 (38 ) (441 )% Total net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests (417 ) 142 (559 ) (393 )% Interest and dividend income 65 74 (9 ) (13 )% Interest expense (66 ) (49 ) (17 ) 33 % Other non controlling interest2 (1 ) (2 ) 1 67 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (584 ) (353 )% Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) 50 419 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ (534 ) (348 )% NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and administration expenses decreased $125 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Other general and administration costs decreased $75 million, or 50%, to $78 million from $153 million, primarily related to a $49 million decrease in foreign currency remeasurement costs and $26 million decrease in costs associated with the support of two enhanced cash funds. Closed end funds launch costs decreased $27 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 due to three closed end funds launched during the year ended December 31, 2007, which generated approximately $3.0 billion in AUM as compared to two closed end funds launched in the year ended December 31, 2008, which generated approximately $400 million in AUM. Professional services decreased $17 million, or 18%, to $77 million compared to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to decreases in accounting, tax and other consulting costs related to the MLIM integration in 2007. Marketing and promotional expenses decreased $13 million, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in travel and promotional expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an $8 million, or 6%, increase in occupancy expenses to $138 million compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of expansion of offices worldwide (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction). Restructuring Charges For the year ended December 31, 2008, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $38 million, primarily related to severance, outplacement costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a 9% reduction in work force. See Restructuring charges discussion in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded a one time expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $16 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the full year impact of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Quellos Transaction. 48 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Total non operating income (expense) $ (574 ) $ 529 $ (1,103 ) (208 )% Non controlling interests (155 ) 364 (519 ) 143 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests $ (419 ) $ 165 $ (584 ) (353 )% The components of non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2008 2007 Amount % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests: Net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ (28 ) $ 65 $ (93 ) (144 )% Real estate (127 ) 34 (161 ) (475 )% Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (194 ) 23 (217 ) NM Investments related to deferred compensation plans (38 ) 12 (50 ) (419 )% Other investments1 (30 ) 8 (38 ) (441 )% Total net gain (loss) on investments, net of non controlling interests (417 ) 142 (559 ) (393 )% Interest and dividend income 65 74 (9 ) (13 )% Interest expense (66 ) (49 ) (17 ) 33 % Other non controlling interest2 (1 ) (2 ) 1 67 % Total non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (584 ) (353 )% Compensation expense related to depreciation (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans 38 (12 ) 50 419 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ (381 ) $ 153 $ (534 ) (348 )% NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 49 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2007.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Non Operating Income (Expense), Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, decreased $584 million to $419 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to non operating income, net of non controlling interests of $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net non operating income primarily reflects declines in valuations from seed investments and co investments in real estate funds, private equity and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds (which includes the impact of a $141 million decline in valuations of distressed credit products) and a $50 million decline in valuations of investments associated with certain deferred compensation plans. In addition, net interest expense increased $26 million primarily related to incremental interest expense related to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in September 2007. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $388 million and $464 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.0%, as compared to 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a one time tax benefit of $51 million recognized in 2007 due to tax legislation changes enacted in the third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany, which resulted in a revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined as compared to the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the impact of foreign taxes. Operating Income and Operating Margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,593 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $299 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The Companys operating margin was 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the impact of a $50 million foreign currency remeasurement benefit and a $38 million deferred compensation benefit due to depreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans, offset by $38 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund servicing and administration arrangements of $128 million, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions and $20 million of MLIM integration costs. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,662 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was an increase of $144 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 38.7% and 37.5% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The growth of operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily related to the impact of $219 million of revenue growth (including the full year impact of the Quellos Transaction) and the impact of a $49 million decline in foreign currency remeasurement costs, offset by a $91 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $16 million increase in amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily associated with the Quellos Transaction. Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2007.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees.

Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Variance% 2008 2007 Variance% GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,593 $ 1,294 23 % $ 1,662 $ 1,518 9 % Non operating income (expense), net of non controlling interests (419 ) 165 (354 )% (381 ) 153 (349 )% Income tax expense (388 ) (464 ) (16 )% (423 ) (592 ) (29 )% Net income $ 786 $ 995 (21 )% $ 858 $ 1,079 (20 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.91 $ 7.53 (22 )% $ 6.45 $ 8.17 (21 )% Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes operating income of $1,593, or $8.02 per diluted share, and non operating losses, net of non controlling interests, of $419 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, versus an $0.80 gain per diluted share in 2007. Net income totaled $786 million, or $5.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was a decrease of $209 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the after tax impact of the portion of LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC, an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees and restructuring charges of $39 million, $7 million, and $26 million, respectively. Net income of $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the after tax impact related to the termination of certain closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements of $82 million, the portion of certain LTIP awards which will be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock stock held by PNC of $34 million, MLIM integration costs of $13 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $6 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. Exclusive of these items in both periods, diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1.72, or 21%, to $6.45 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, is described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 51 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2007.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 The following table presents the component changes in BlackRocks AUM for 2007.

Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, which closed on September 29, 2006. With the exception of BlackRock Solutions and advisory, the magnitude of the acquired business is the primary driver of most line item variances in the analysis below comparing the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2,747 million, or 131%, to $4,845 million, compared with $2,098 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $2,747 million increase was primarily the result of a $2,519 million increase in total investment advisory and administration fees, an $87 million increase in distribution fees, a $50 million increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory, and a $91 million increase in other revenue. Investment Advisory and Administration Fees The increase in investment advisory and administration fees of $2,519 million, or 137%, was the result of an increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million, or 151%, to $4,010 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, along with an increase of $108 million in investment advisory performance fees. Investment advisory and administration base fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the MLIM Transaction, which added $589 billion in AUM on September 29, 2006 and additional increased AUM of $232 billion during 2007. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees of $2,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of increases of $1,593 million in equity and balanced products, $317 million in cash management products, $311 million in fixed income products, and $190 million in alternative investment products. The increase in investment advisory and administration base fees for all products was driven by AUM acquired in the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, as well as increases in AUM of $66 billion, $65 billion, $78 billion and $23 billion, respectively, over the past twelve months, which includes the $22 billion of alternative investment AUM acquired in the Quellos Transaction. Investment advisory performance fees increased by $108 million, or 45%, to $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher performance fees on equity and fixed income hedge funds, as well as real estate equity products. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue of $198 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $50 million, or 34%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue was primarily the result of additional advisory and Aladdin assignments during the period. Distribution Fees Distribution fees increased by $87 million to $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in distribution fees is primarily due to the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from the MLIM Transaction in third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007, which resulted in the Company receiving distribution fees from such arrangements. Other Revenue Other revenue of $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $91 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. Other revenue represents property management fees of $38 million earned on real estate products (primarily related to reimbursement of salaries and benefits of certain Metric employees from certain real estate products), fees for fund accounting of $27 million, net interest related to securities lending of $27 million and $14 million for other advisory service fees. 53 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years.

Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Revenue (continued) The increase in other revenue of $91 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of an increase of $25 million in unit trust sales commissions, an increase of $21 million in fees earned related to securities lending, a $15 million increase in fund accounting services, and a $14 million increase for other advisory service fees. Expenses (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 1,767 $ 934 $ 833 89 % Portfolio administration and servicing costs 548 173 375 217 % Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions 108 30 78 260 % General and administration 870 417 453 109 % Termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements 128 128 NM Fee sharing payment 34 (34 ) (100 )% Amortization of intangible assets 130 38 92 242 % Total expenses $ 3,551 $ 1,626 $ 1,925 118 % NM Not Meaningful Total expenses, which reflect the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction on September 29, 2006, increased $1,925 million, or 118%, to $3,551 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $1,626 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total expenses included integration charges related to the MLIM Transaction of $20 million and $142 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2007 included $20 million of total MLIM and Quellos integration charges primarily in general and administration, compared to integration charges of $45 million related to employee compensation and benefits and $97 million related to general and administration, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits increased by $833 million, or 89%, to $1,767 million, at December 31, 2007 compared to $934 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation, salaries and benefits and stock based compensation of $406 million, $368 million and $66 million, respectively. The $406 million, increase in incentive compensation is primarily attributable to higher operating income and direct incentives associated with higher performance fees earned on the Companys alternative investment products. The $368 million increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels associated with the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Employees (including employees of Metric) at December 31, 2007 totaled 5,952 as compared to 5,113 at December 31, 2006. 54 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) Portfolio Administration and Servicing Costs Portfolio administration and servicing costs increased $375 million to $548 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These costs include payments to Merrill Lynch under the global distribution agreement, and payments to PNC as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Portfolio administration and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $444 million of costs attributable to Merrill Lynch and affiliates and $28 million of costs attributable to PNC and other affiliates as compared to $96 million and $25 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. Portfolio administration and servicing costs related to other non related parties increased $28 million as a result of an expansion of distribution platforms. Amortization of Deferred Mutual Fund Sales Commissions Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions increased by $78 million to $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions was primarily the result of the acquisition of distribution financing arrangements from MLIM at the end of third quarter 2006 and from PNC in second quarter 2007. General and Administration Expense (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % General and administration expense: Portfolio services $ 170 $ 52 $ 118 228 % Marketing and promotional 169 100 69 69 % Occupancy 130 64 66 103 % Technology 118 61 57 93 % Professional services 94 73 21 30 % Closed end fund launch costs 36 11 25 207 % Other general and administration 153 56 97 177 % Total general and administration expense $ 870 $ 417 $ 453 109 % General and administration expense increased $453 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $870 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 55 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expense (continued) Portfolio services costs increased by $118 million to $170 million, relating to supporting higher AUM levels and increased trading activities. Marketing and promotional expense increased $69 million, or 69%, to $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased marketing activities, including $85 million related to domestic and international marketing efforts, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million related to BlackRocks advertising and rebranding campaign in 2006. Occupancy costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $130 million, representing a $66 million, or 103%, increase from $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in occupancy costs primarily reflects costs related to the expansion of corporate facilities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and business growth. Technology expenses increased $57 million, or 93%, to $118 million compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $13 million increase in technology consulting expenses, a $19 million increase in hardware depreciation expense and a $15 million increase in software licensing and maintenance costs. Closed end fund launch costs totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 relating to three new closed end funds launched during the year, generating approximately $3.0 billion in AUM. Closed end fund launch costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $11 million relating to three new closed end funds launched during the period, generating $2.2 billion in AUM. Professional services increased $21 million, or 30%, to $94 million compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to increased accounting, tax and legal services necessary to support business growth. Other general and administration costs increased by $97 million to $153 million from $56 million, including $24 million of capital contributions to two enhanced cash funds in support of fund net asset values and a $12 million charge reflecting the valuation of capital support agreements covering certain securities remaining in the funds and a $32 million increase in office related expenses. Termination of Closed end Fund Administration and Servicing Arrangements For the year ended December 31, 2007, BlackRock recorded an expense of $128 million related to the termination of administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch on 40 closed end funds with original terms of 30 40 years. Fee Sharing Payment For the year ended December 31, 2006, BlackRock recorded a fee sharing payment of $34 million, representing a payment related to a large institutional real estate equity client account acquired in the SSR Transaction in January 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets The $92 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets to $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily reflects amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. 56 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Total non operating income $ 529 $ 56 $ 473 NM Non controlling interests 364 16 (348 ) NM Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests $ 165 $ 40 $ 125 313 % NM Not Meaningful The components of non operating income, net of non controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, Variance 2007 2006 Amount % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests: Net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests: Private equity $ 65 $ $ 65 NM Real estate 34 1 33 NM Hedge funds/funds of hedge funds 23 7 16 228 % Investments related to deferred compensation plans 12 8 4 50 % Other investments1 8 5 3 60 % Total net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests 142 21 121 NM Other non controlling interest2 (2 ) (2 ) NM Interest and dividend income 74 29 45 153 % Interest expense (49 ) (10 ) (39 ) 398 % Total non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 125 313 % Compensation expense related to (appreciation) on deferred compensation plans (12 ) (8 ) (4 ) (50 )% Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, as adjusted $ 153 $ 32 $ 121 378 % NM Not Meaningful 1 Includes net gains/(losses) related to equity and fixed income investments, CDOs and BlackRocks seed capital hedging program. 2 Includes non controlling interest related to operating entities (non investment activities). 57 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Non Operating Income, Net of Non Controlling Interests (continued) Non operating income, net of non controlling interests, increased $125 million to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of a $121 million increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, and a $45 million increase in interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $39 million increase in interest expense primarily related to borrowings under BlackRocks revolving credit agreement and the $700 million issuance of long term debt in September 2007. The increase in net gain on investments, net of non controlling interests, was primarily due to market appreciation and investment gains from seed investments in private equity products, real estate equity products and other alternative products including hedge funds and funds of funds, partially offset by $14 million of increased impairments related to seed investments in collateralized debt obligations. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $464 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, representing effective income tax rates of 31.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a one time deferred income tax benefit of $51 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2007, due to tax legislation changes enacted in third quarter 2007 in the United Kingdom and Germany that reduced corporate income tax rates in those jurisdictions in 2008. Accordingly, BlackRock revalued its deferred tax liabilities in these jurisdictions. Excluding this deferred income tax benefit, the 2007 adjusted effective tax rate was 35.3%. Operating Income and Operating margin GAAP Operating income totaled $1,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $822 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin was 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of $128 million for the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $42 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, $20 million of integration costs, as well as the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect $142 million of integration costs, $14 million of closed end fund launch costs and commissions, the impact of the MLIM Transaction subsequent to closing on September 29, 2006, as well as a $34 million fee sharing payment in conjunction with the SSR Transaction. As Adjusted Operating income, as adjusted, totaled $1,518 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which was an increase of $844 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating margin, as adjusted, was 37.5% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income and operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 include the full year impact of the MLIM Transaction, as well as the impact of the Quellos Transaction which closed on October 1, 2007. Operating margin and operating income, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 58 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006 (continued) Net Income The components of net income and net income, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Year ended December 31, Variance% Year ended December 31, Variance% 2007 2006 2007 2006 GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Operating income $ 1,294 $ 472 174 % $ 1,518 $ 674 125 % Non operating income, net of non controlling interests 165 40 313 % 153 32 378 % Income tax expense (464 ) (189 ) 146 % (592 ) (261 ) 127 % Net income $ 995 $ 323 208 % $ 1,079 $ 445 142 % Diluted earnings per share $ 7.53 $ 3.87 95 % $ 8.17 $ 5.33 53 % Net income totaled $995 million, or $7.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was an increase of $672 million, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $82 million related to the after tax impacts of the termination of closed end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, $34 million related to the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, $13 million related to integration costs associated with the MLIM Transactions and $6 million related to an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. In addition, the United Kingdom and Germany enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates resulting in a one time decrease of $51 million in income tax expense which is included in net income. MLIM integration costs primarily include compensation costs, professional fees and rebranding costs. Net income of $323 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 included the after tax impacts of the portion of certain LTIP awards to be funded through a capital contribution of $32 million of BlackRock common stock held by PNC, MLIM integration costs of $89 million and an expected contribution by Merrill Lynch of $1 million to fund certain compensation of former MLIM employees. Exclusive of these items, fully diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.84, or 53%, to $8.17 compared to $5.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Sources of BlackRocks operating cash include investment advisory and administration fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, mutual fund distribution fees and realized earnings and distributions on the Companys investments. BlackRock primarily uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, portfolio administration and servicing costs, general and administration expenses, interest on the Companys borrowings, purchases of co and seed investments, capital expenditures, income taxes and dividends on BlackRocks capital stock. 59 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds In accordance with GAAP, certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of BlackRock, notwithstanding the fact that BlackRock may only have a minority economic interest in these funds. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to our ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact on cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds: Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,916 $ 413 $ 1,503 Cash flows from investing activities (394 ) (9 ) (385 ) Cash flows from financing activities (887 ) (410 ) (477 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (259 ) (259 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 376 (6 ) 382 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 1,656 67 1,589 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 2,032 $ 61 $ 1,971 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, at December 31, 2008 increased $382 million from December 31, 2007, primarily resulting from $1,503 million of cash inflows from operating activities, offset by $385 million of cash outflows from investing activities, $477 million of cash outflows from financing activities, and a $259 million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rates. 60 PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds (continued) Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, in the year ended December 31, 2008 included cash payments related to year end incentive compensation that is paid in the first quarter. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include net purchases of investments that are made to establish a performance track record, to co invest with clients or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily include $419 million of payments for cash dividends and a net $100 million repayment of short term borrowings. Capital Resources The Company manages its consolidated financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,032 $ 1,656 Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds1 (61 ) (67 ) Regulatory capital2 (172 ) (217 ) 2007 credit facility undrawn3,4 2,171 2,100 Committed access $ 3,970 $ 3,472 1 The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. 2 Partially met with cash and cash equivalents. 3 Net of outstanding letters of credit totaling $0 million and $100 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 4 Excludes $129 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2008 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. In addition, a significant portion of the Companys $1,011 million of net economic investments are illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. Short term Borrowings In August 2007, the Company entered into a five year $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2007 facility), which permits the Company to request an additional $500 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, up to a maximum of $3 billion. The 2007 facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to EBITDA, where net debt equals total debt less domestic unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 0.5 to 1 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and a maturity date during February 2009. 61 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term Borrowings (continued) Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. has a $140 million participation under the 2007 facility; however, BlackRock does not expect that Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. will honor its commitment to fund additional amounts. In addition, in December 2007, in order to support two enhanced cash funds that BlackRock manages, BlackRock elected to procure two letters of credit under the 2007 facility in an aggregate amount of $100 million. In December 2008, the letters of credit were terminated. In June 2008, BlackRock Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five billion Japanese yen commitment line agreement with a banking institution (the Japan Commitment line). The term of the Japan Commitment line is one year and interest will accrue at the applicable Japanese short term prime rate. The Japan Commitment line is intended to provide liquidity flexibility for operating requirements in Japan. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Japan Commitment line. Conversion of Convertible Debentures During 2008 During October 2008, the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders into cash and shares of the Companys common stock after the trustee determined that the trading price for the convertible debentures on each day of a five consecutive trading day period was less than 103% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date. During the conversion period holders of $0.5 million of convertible debentures elected to convert their holdings into cash and shares. Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds At December 31, 2008, BlackRock managed approximately $338 billion in cash management assets. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was held by two private placement enhanced cash funds. During 2007 and 2008, market events reduced the liquidity of certain securities, including securities issued by asset backed structured investment vehicles held by these two funds. During 2007, BlackRock made investments in the funds to enhance fund liquidity and to facilitate redemptions. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks total net investment in these two funds was approximately $82 million. BlackRock also provided capital contributions in 2007 and 2008 totaling $24 million and $3 million, respectively, to help preserve a one dollar net asset value per share for these two funds. These capital contributions resulted in an increase to general and administration expense. In December 2007, BlackRock entered into capital support agreements with the two funds, backed by letters of credit drawn under BlackRocks existing credit facility. Pursuant to the capital support agreements, BlackRock agreed to make subsequent capital contributions to the funds to cover realized losses, up to $100 million, related to specified securities held by the funds. In December 2008, BlackRocks maximum potential obligation under the capital support agreements was reduced to $45 million, and in January 2009, one capital support agreement was terminated, due to the closure of the related fund, leaving only one capital support agreement, with a total $20 million potential obligation outstanding. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the funds distributed approximately $100 million in aggregate to investors as a result of security sales and maturities. 62 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Support of Two Enhanced Cash Funds (continued) BlackRock recorded $12 million and $7 million in general and administration expense in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a corresponding liability at December 31, 2008 related to the fair value of the capital support agreements with the two funds. The fair value of the potential liability related to the capital support agreements will fluctuate in subsequent periods based principally on projected cash flows of the specified securities covered by the capital support agreements and market liquidity. In addition, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time, purchase securities from the funds at the greater of the funds amortized cost or fair value. In the event securities are purchased at amortized cost, a loss would be recorded based on the difference from fair value. During 2008, BlackRock purchased one security resulting in $6 million of non operating losses. At December 31, 2008, in applying the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46(R)), BlackRock concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the two enhanced cash funds which resulted in consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2007, BlackRock concluded it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. Exposure to Collateralized Debt Obligations In the normal course of business, BlackRock acts as a collateral manager to various CDOs. A CDO is a managed investment vehicle that purchases a portfolio of assets or enters into swaps. A CDO funds its activities through the issuance of several tranches of debt and equity, the repayment and return of which are linked to the performance of the assets in the CDO. The Company also may invest in a portion of the debt or equity issued. These entities meet the definition of a variable interest entity under FIN 46(R). BlackRock has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs, and as a result it does not consolidate these CDOs on its consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks carrying value of investments in these CDOs on the statement of financial condition was approximately $4 million. In addition, BlackRock manages a series of credit default swap transactions, referred to collectively as the Pillars synthetic CDO transaction, which is backed by a portfolio of both investment grade corporate and structured finance exposures. In connection with the transaction, BlackRock has entered into a credit default swap with a counterparty to provide credit protection of $17 million, which represents the Companys maximum risk of loss with respect to the provision of credit protection. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the credit default swap was approximately $0.5 million and was included on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition in other liabilities. At December 31, 2008, BlackRocks maximum risk of additional loss related to CDOs was approximately $20 million. Capital Activities On August 2, 2006, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase an additional 2.1 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Pursuant to this repurchase program, BlackRock may make repurchases from time to time, as market conditions warrant, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The Company repurchased 1,348,600 shares under the program in open market transactions for approximately $200.9 million through December 31, 2008. The Company did not repurchase any shares under the program during 2008. As a result, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase an additional 751,400 shares under its share repurchase program. 63 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain international jurisdictions, which is met in part by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may be restricted in its ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. At December 31, 2008, the Company was required to maintain approximately $172 million in net capital at these subsidiaries and is in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment as of December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Long term borrowings1 Long term notes $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 44 $ 875 $ 1,095 Convertible debentures 257 257 Other 1 1 2 Short term borrowings 200 200 Operating leases 62 58 55 50 47 274 546 Purchase obligations 35 18 7 3 63 Investment / loan commitments 9 49 16 1 34 192 301 Total contractual obligations and commitments 608 170 122 98 125 1,341 2,464 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 401 401 401 401 401 2,005 Contingent payments related to business acquisitions 285 10 595 890 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations2 $ 1,294 $ 581 $ 1,118 $ 499 $ 526 $ 1,341 $ 5,359 1 Amounts include principal repayments and interest payments. 2 The table above does not include: (a) approximately $76 million of uncertain tax positions and potential interest on such positions in accordance with FIN No. 48 and (b) $45 million related to capital support agreements (of which $25 million terminated in January 2009) for the two enhanced cash funds as the Company is unable to estimate the timing of the ultimate outcome. 64 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Long term Borrowings Long term Notes At December 31, 2008, long term borrowings were $946 million. Debt service and repayment requirements, assuming the Companys 2.625% Convertible Debenture due 2035 (the convertible debentures) are converted at the option of the holders in 2009 are $302 million in 2009, $45 million in 2010 and $44 million in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole premium. The Notes were issued at a discount of $6 million, which is being amortized over the ten year term. Convertible Debentures In February 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due in 2035 and bearing interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or approximately $6.5 million per year. The convertible debentures are callable by the Company at any time on or after February 20, 2010. In addition, the convertible debentures contain certain put and conversion provisions. However, beginning in February 2009 the convertible debentures became convertible at the option of the holders. On the contractual obligations table above, the remaining $249.5 million principal balance of the convertible debentures is assumed, although not determined, to be repaid in 2009. Short term Borrowings At December 31, 2008, the Company had $200 million outstanding under the 2007 facility with an interest rate of 0.61% and a maturity date during January 2009. During January 2009, the Company rolled over the $200 million in borrowings with an interest rate of 0.56% and maturity date during February 2009. Operating Leases The Company leases its primary office space under agreements that currently expire through 2023. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2008, the Companys obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data and office related services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements only after the goods or services have been received and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. 65 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment /Loan Commitments At December 31, 2008, the Company had $292 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown. Therefore, amounts are shown to be paid upon the expiration date of the commitment. Actual payments could be made at any time prior to such expiration date and, if not called by that date, such commitments would expire. These commitments have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 2008. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding commitments. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. At December 31, 2008, the Company had loans outstanding of approximately $167 million to a warehouse entity established for certain private equity funds of funds, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2008, the Company was not committed to make additional loans to the warehouse entity. In January 2009, approximately $29 million was repaid while the remainder is expected to be fully repaid on, or about, March 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company was committed to provide financing to Anthracite Capital, Inc. (Anthracite), a specialty commercial real estate finance company that is managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock, of up to $60 million until March 2010. The financing is collateralized by Anthracite pledging its ownership interest in an investment fund which is also managed by a subsidiary of BlackRock. At December 31, 2008, $30 million of financing was outstanding, which matures in April 2009 at an interest rate of 6.02%, which was included in due from related parties on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Anthracite borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which matures in April 2009, at a current interest rate of 4.76%. The $33.5 million of financing outstanding may be renewed upon maturity for an additional period of time. As a general partner in certain private equity partnerships, the Company receives certain carried interest distributions from the partnerships according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations BlackRock has entered into an Amended and Restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of assets under management maintained in BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic 3 year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimate for 2009, which due to uncertainty of future sales and asset levels, has been held constant for 2010 through 2013. Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions Amounts included in the table above are additional contingent payments to be paid in cash related to its acquisitions of: (i) SSRM Holdings, Inc. and (ii) certain assets of Quellos. As the remaining contingent obligations are primarily dependent upon achievement of certain operating measures, the ultimate liabilities are not certain as of December 31, 2008 and have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the maximum amount of cash that could be payable at the earliest possible date under the terms of the business purchase agreements. 66 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Contingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions (continued) SSRM Holdings: In January 2005, the Company closed its acquisition of SSRM Holdings, Inc. from MetLife for adjusted consideration of approximately $265 million in cash and 550,000 restricted shares of BlackRock common stock and certain additional contingent payments. In January 2010, the fifth anniversary of the closing of the SSR Transaction, MetLife may be entitled to receive an additional payment of up to a maximum of $10 million based on the Companys retained AUM associated with the MetLife defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Quellos: In connection with the Quellos Transaction, Quellos may be entitled to receive two contingent payments upon achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through December 31, 2010, totaling up to an additional $969 million in a combination of cash and stock. The first contingent payment, of up to $374 million, is payable in April 2009 up to 25% in BlackRock common stock and the remainder in cash. As of December 31, 2008, it is estimated that the first contingent payment will equal approximately $300 million, of which $11 million has been paid in cash during 2008. Of the remaining $289 million, $217 million will be paid in cash and $72 million in common stock based on a price of $157.33 in April 2009. The ultimate amount of the first contingent payment will not be certain until March 31, 2009. The second contingent payment, of up to $595 million, is payable in cash in 2011. Quellos may also be entitled to a catch up payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures are met through 2010 to the extent that the value of the first contingent payment is less than $374 million. A portion of the second contingent payment, not to exceed $90 million, may be paid to Quellos based on factors including continued employment with BlackRock. Therefore, this portion, not to exceed $90 million, would be recorded as employee compensation. On the contractual obligation table above, the maximum remaining payments are included for each contingent payment. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Impact Investing In connection with the Impact Investing acquisition, the Company may be required to make several additional contingent payments, which are not expected to be material, upon completion of certain operating measures through 2010. Currently, the payments are anticipated to be recorded as employee compensation. Compensation and Benefit Obligations The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2008 totaled $826 million and included incentive compensation of $645 million, deferred compensation of $71 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $110 million. Incentive compensation was primarily paid in the first quarter of 2009, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years. 67 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Separate Account Liabilities The Companys wholly owned registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom maintains separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owner and, as such, an offsetting separate account liability is recorded. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $2.6 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications In many of the Companys contracts, including the MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2008. See further discussion in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Investments Consolidation of Investments The accounting method used for the Companys investments generally is dependent upon the influence the Company has over its investee. For investments where BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, the investee is consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. Pursuant to FIN 46(R), for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests (variable interest entities or VIEs), an investee may be consolidated if BlackRock is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. If the Company, and its related parties, is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity will be consolidated within BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. In order to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. 68 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Consolidation of Investments (continued) At December 31, 2008, the Company applied an expected loss model to certain VIEs and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds, resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company, as general partner or managing member of its funds, is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, the investment vehicle will be consolidated into BlackRocks financial statements. BlackRock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds. In December 2008, BlackRock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at December 31, 2008 of approximately $210 million. The granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, as a result of consolidation of various investment products, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 67 Investments 728 1,054 Other net assets (liabilities) 12 (218 ) Non controlling interests (491 ) (578 ) Total exposure to consolidated investment funds $ 310 $ 325 The Company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to EITF No. 85 12, Retention of Specialized Accounting for Investments in Consolidation. 69 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $501 million and $16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2007 the Company had $517 million and $5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than its cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income. The Company evaluates its CDO investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment. The Company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CDO investment. If the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows, an impairment is considered other than temporary. The impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value. 70 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1. The impact of SFAS No. 160 is not included below as it will not have an impact on EPS.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded other than temporary impairments of $8 million, $16 million and $2 million, respectively, related to debt securities and CDO available for sale investments. The other than temporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of CDO investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the Company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements BlackRock adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) as of January 1, 2008, which requires, among other things, enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2, and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the Level 3 category (which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment), including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets include listed mutual funds, equities and certain debt securities. Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. Assets which generally are included in this category may include short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount. Level 3 Inputs Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, and funds of hedge funds. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. 71 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) BlackRock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. For certain investments, including investments classified as trading investments, equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds, changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change. For other investments classified as available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders equity and generally do not directly impact BlackRocks net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired (see below). Marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data. Non marketable securities, however, generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources, including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment, valuation services from third party providers, internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or, in the absence of other market data and resources, the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the Companys management based on a number of factors, including the liquidity, financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment. Changes in fair value on approximately $1.3 billion of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense) and approximately $100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008, changes in fair value of approximately $728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact BlackRocks non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is $310 million. BlackRocks $813 million of Level 3 investments at December 31, 2008 primarily include co investments in real estate equity products, private equity fund of funds and private equity funds, funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities. Many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources, however, in some instances current valuation information, for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active, may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reclassified approximately $29 million of net investments out of Level 3. The majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the Company uses that certain significant inputs, including performance attributes, for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately $200 million of Level 3 investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 72 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) The following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008: (Dollar amounts in millions) Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) OtherInvestmentsNot Held atFair Value (3) Investments atDecember 31, 2008 Total investments, GAAP $ 176 $ 400 $ 813 $ 40 $ 1,429 Net assets for which the Company does not bear economic exposure (1) (6 ) (255 ) (157 ) (418 ) Net economic investments (2) $ 170 $ 145 $ 656 $ 40 $ 1,011 (1) Consists of net assets attributable to non controlling investors of consolidated sponsored investment funds. (2) Includes BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other liabilities that are consolidated from sponsored investment funds. (3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

(3) Includes investments in equity method investees and investments held at cost, which in accordance with GAAP are not accounted for under a fair value measure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2008, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2008 Goodwill $ 5,533 Intangible assets Indefinitelived 5,378 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization 1,063 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 11,974 The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open end funds and closed end funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset. The assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2008, ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 7.7 years. 73 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs. The tables below present the basic and diluted EPS impact of the retrospective application upon adoption of both FSP APB 14 1 and FSP EITF 03 6 1.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Goodwill The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. At July 31, 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2008 the Companys common stock closed at $134.15 which exceeded its book value of approximately $93 per share. Intangibles The Company assesses its indefinite lived management contracts for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as AUM, product mix, product margins, and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. The fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of finite lived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, if such circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined. Expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment, including market interest rates, equity prices, credit default ratings, discount rates, revenue multiples, inflation rates and AUM growth rates. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In both July and September 2008, as well as during 2007 and 2006, the Company performed impairment tests, which indicated no impairment charges were required. The Company continues to monitor various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $146 million, $130 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 74 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Recent Accounting Developments EPS Impact Related to Retrospective Application of Recent Accounting Developments Pursuant to FSP APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14 1), the Company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures. Pursuant to FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), the Companys outstanding unvested stock based payment awards are considered participating securities as the awards contain non forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents. In accordance with FSP EITF 03 6 1, the two class method is used to determine EPS for common stock and for participating securities. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that allocates distributed and undistributed earnings to each class of common shareholders and participating RSUs.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. BlackRock adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on, among other things, de recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. The application of SFAS No. 109 and FIN No. 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, which require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2008, BlackRock had $114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $60 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1,825 million on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. Further, the Company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $44 million and current income taxes payable of $120 million at December 31, 2008. 75 Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate separate accounts, net operating income generated by the underlying properties, and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. Certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions. The Company contracts with third parties, as well as related parties, for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non U.S. funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the Companys management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $762 million, $780 million and $156 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which, due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income. The Company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts. These performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, performance fee revenue totaled $177 million, $350 million and $242 million, respectively. The Company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments. BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $21 million and $29 million, respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $406 million, $198 million and $148 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back of carried interest is mathematically improbable. 76 Item 7.

Related Party Transactions See related party transactions discussion in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. 79 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that all investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors depending on the circumstances for approval. AUM Market Price Risk BlackRocks investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2008, the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUM of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. Investments generally are made to establish a performance track record, for co investment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, approximately $728 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Including the impact of the seed capital hedging program, the Companys net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Total investments $ 1,429 $ 2,000 Consolidated sponsored investments funds (728 ) (1,054 ) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 310 325 Total net economic investments 1,011 1,271 Hedged investments (49 ) (94 ) Total net economic investment exposure $ 962 $ 1,177 The net economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Market Price Risk At December 31, 2008, the Companys net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately $655 million of the Companys net economic investment exposure. Investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $65.5 million in the carrying value of such investments. 80 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued) Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk At December 31, 2008, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately $307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $2.8 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, was $46 million. A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.

A 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $4.6 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.
