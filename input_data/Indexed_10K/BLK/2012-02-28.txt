Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 1,278 Non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 General and administration 65 123 Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 UK lease exit costs 63 Restructuring charges 32 22 PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 59 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 18 Operating income, as adjusted 3,392 3,167 1,570 Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 2 Closed end fund launch commissions 3 2 1 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,421 $ 3,184 $ 1,573 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 4,700 Non GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (386 ) (408 ) (477 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (81 ) (102 ) (100 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,614 $ 8,102 $ 4,123 Operating margin, GAAP basis 35.8 % 34.8 % 27.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 39.7 % 39.3 % 38.2 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. 41 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) Operating income, as adjusted: BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. Restructuring charges recorded in 2011 and 2009 consisted of compensation costs and professional fees. Restructuring charges in 2009 also included occupancy costs. UK lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRocks book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period to period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non operating income., Examples of such adjustments include restructuring charges, BGI transaction and integration costs, UK lease exit costs, closed end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark to market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Companys revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. 42 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests (NCI), as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (6 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 2 (13 ) 22 Non operating income (expense) (1) (116 ) 36 (28 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) (18 ) Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (46 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests. Management believes non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non operating results that impact book value. 43 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis $ 2,337 $ 2,063 $ 875 Non GAAP adjustments, net of tax: (d) BGI transaction/integration costs 59 129 UK lease exit costs 43 Restructuring charges 22 14 PNC LTIP funding obligation 30 40 41 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 5 7 7 Income tax law changes/election (198 ) (30 ) (45 ) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted $ 2,239 $ 2,139 $ 1,021 Allocation of net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Common shares (e) $ 2,218 $ 2,109 $ 995 Participating restricted stock units 21 30 26 Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted $ 2,239 $ 2,139 $ 1,021 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (e) 187,116,410 192,692,047 139,481,449 Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis (e) $ 12.37 $ 10.55 $ 6.11 Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (e) $ 11.85 $ 10.94 $ 7.13 See note (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on BGI transaction/integration costs, UK lease exit costs, PNC LTIP funding obligation, Merrill Lynch compensation contribution and restructuring charges. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, adjustments primarily related to a state tax election and certain enacted UK, Japan, US state and local tax legislation, which resulted in the re measurement of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting increase or decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability for periods presented. (d) For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.8%, 33% and 30%, respectively, which reflects the blended rate applicable to the adjustments. (e) Non voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain unvested restricted stock units are not included in this number as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 260 10, Earnings per Share. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 average outstanding participating securities were 1.8 million, 2.8 million and 3.8 million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of products, including passively and actively managed equities, fixed income, multi asset class, cash management and alternatives. BlackRock offers clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective investment trusts, open end and closed end mutual funds, exchange traded products, hedge funds, and funds of funds. BlackRock provides global advisory services for private investment funds and retail products. The Companys non U.S. investment funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, cash management and alternatives. In the United States retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds, including iShares, the global product leader in exchange traded products for institutional, retail and high net worth investors. There are 504 iShares products globally across equities, fixed income and commodities, which trade like common stocks on 20 exchanges worldwide. iShares AUM totaled $593.4 billion at December 31, 2011. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Companys primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in 35 jurisdictions worldwide. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension plans, charities, official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational authorities and other government entities, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. 45 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $10 trillion of positions are processed on the Companys Aladdin operating platform, which serves as the investment/ risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite lived intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs. Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third party non advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including foreign currency remeasurement costs. Non operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available for sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available for sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading or other investment activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations. The portion of non operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to non controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. 46 Table of Contents Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

(4) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (5) Advisory AUM represents long term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM decreased approximately $48.3 billion, or 1%, to $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011 from $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010. The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $67.3 billion of long term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011. Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7 billion. The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Business Outlook The diversity of the Companys business model, which offers a significant breadth of asset classes along with alpha and beta management styles, and its global reach, allows BlackRock to capture asset flows as investor sentiment shifts. BlackRock finished 2011 with strong index flows as clients continued to rebalance their portfolios from active products due to volatile market conditions. BlackRock expects such conditions to continue into 2012 due to the European sovereign debt crisis, global political elections in 2012, and continued unrest in the Middle East. 49 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) In early 2012, BlackRock continues to see signs of economic strength in the U.S. as the pace of expansion accelerates and the unemployment rate declines. During 2012, BlackRock expects emerging economies to outperform, while the U.S. and Japan grow at lower rates and Europe faces a slow economic recovery. BlackRock will actively monitor global monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates), bank lending policies, the Euro crisis, global political elections, and the U.S. debt ceiling and housing market along with the effects on global corporate earnings growth. The Company offers a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi asset and alternative products designed to track various indices, target returns in excess of specified benchmarks or focus on absolute returns. BlackRocks broad set of product offerings, risk skills and tools allow the Company to work with clients in meeting their investment objectives over both short and long term horizons. While investing for stable income continues to be a core objective of many clients, BlackRock expects clients to trend towards indexing, retirement and income, alternatives and multi asset class solutions along with risk management tools and advisory services. The following items could impact the Companys results in 2012 and beyond: AUM and Flows As investors shift preferences between asset classes, and active and passive investment styles, the Companys broad product profile, including a wide array of offerings in asset types and management styles, should enable it to retain and capture revenue. As equity markets improve and with no sign of rising interest rates from their historic lows in the near term, BlackRock expects clients who in the latter half of 2011 were delaying investment decisions, to re risk into beta and alpha equity and alternative products. BlackRocks unique combination of index and active capabilities positions it well to assist companies in narrowing the gap on underfunded pension plans by implementing barbell strategies using a combination of index, alpha and alternative products. In addition, as retirement money moves away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is well positioned to offer individual investment options with its LifePath&reg; target date portfolios and wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. BlackRock has a leading global market share in exchange traded products (ETP) due to its large array of products and AUM in this market. The global growth of the ETP market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid ask spread), tax efficiency, transparency and client service. Industry asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra low interest rates, industry flows shifted toward fixed income oriented products and, within equities, to developed markets and away from broad and single country emerging market funds. Additional asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar exchange traded products at lower fee structures; however, the Company believes that many factors beyond pricing influence investor preferences. BlackRock believes alternative products will become more important for both institutional and retail clients to invest in alpha generating products to generate higher returns. The Company significantly invested in its alternatives platform during 2011 for products expected to be introduced in 2012, which will invest in private equity, renewable power, real estate as well as other opportunistic asset classes. Cash management assets may continue to decline from year end levels if clients begin to re risk their portfolios in search of yield or equity return opportunities as rates remain low, including those in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve currently expects U.S. rates to remain low until 2014. The Companys diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. Regulatory Reform The regulatory environment in 2011 continued to evolve for financial institutions as well as money market funds with the intent of the reform supported by BlackRock, to protect the industry and our clients. Regulatory reform continues to evolve and may affect the competitive environment, including liquidity and trading costs, and may provide BlackRock and its clients with risks as well as opportunities. 50 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees While most of BlackRocks absolute return AUM products eligible for performance fees are marginally below high water marks, a return to higher market levels may enable the Companys alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue. The sovereign uncertainty in 2011 across Europe and an increasing focus on risk management led to unique opportunities for BlackRocks risk tools and advisory services, combining the Companys extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities across an increasingly global client base. In 2012, the Company expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer term risk management solutions as well as strong demand for financial market advisory services. Future opportunities The Company plans to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global BlackRock brand. In addition, it will build out key products and geographic locations as well as an internal trading platform on its enterprise systems to cross trades within its platform and potentially among other client transactions, which is expected to result in lower portfolio transaction costs and ultimately increased performance returns for clients. 51 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Revenue $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 469 5 % Expenses 5,832 5,614 218 4 % Operating income $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 251 8 % Operating margin 35.8 % 34.8 % 1.0 % 3 % The increase in operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to the $469 million increase in revenue primarily due to higher base fees associated with growth in long term average AUM, which included the benefit of higher average markets and the benefit of net new business, and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $218 million net increase in operating expenses related to business growth, including an increase in the number of employees, professional fees and average long dated AUM growth, which affects certain expenses, including direct fund expenses. In addition, operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Companys exit from two London locations and $32 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $90 million of BGI integration costs. Each of these items are excluded from the as adjusted results below.

The increase was partially offset by a $169 million decrease in performance fees primarily reflecting lower fees from hedge funds and a $16 million decrease in distribution fees. 53 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $606 million to $7,896 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This growth primarily reflected growth in average long term AUM, which included the benefit of net new business, partially offset by a decline in fees from cash management products due to lower average AUM and higher fee waivers. Securities lending fees were $397 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $325 million for year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher lending rates.

The decrease was partially offset by higher performance fees due to strong relative performance from regional/country and global equity strategies. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $50 million, or 11%, from the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to on going and additional Aladdin mandates and advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $16 million from $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. 55 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Distribution and servicing costs 386 408 (22 ) (5 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 81 102 (21 ) (21 %) Direct fund expenses 563 493 70 14 % General and administration 1,415 1,354 61 5 % Restructuring charges 32 32 * Amortization of intangible assets 156 160 (4 ) (3 %) Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 (25 ) (100 %) General and administration 65 (65 ) (100 %) Total BGI integration costs 90 (90 ) (100 %) UK lease exit costs 63 63 * Restructuring charges 32 32 * PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non GAAP expense adjustments 143 169 (26 ) (15 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,689 $ 5,445 $ 244 4 % * Not applicable.

Excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $244 million, or 4%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, partially offset by a reduction in distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. 56 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs 25 (25 ) (100 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non GAAP expense adjustments 48 104 (56 ) (54 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 3,151 $ 2,993 $ 158 5 % * Not applicable. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $102 million, or 3%, to $3,199 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $3,097 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Employees at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 10,100 as compared to approximately 9,100 at December 31, 2010. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $158 million, reflecting a $164 million increase in base salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and salary levels, and a $41 million increase in other compensation, including payroll taxes, benefits, and commissions. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease in incentive compensation. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million to $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield support waivers resulting in lower levels of distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open end and closed end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $246 million and $10 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $21 million to $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open end mutual funds contributed to the decline. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $70 million reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominately iShares) where BlackRock pays certain non advisory expenses of the funds. 57 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change General and administration expenses, GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 328 $ (13 ) (4 %) Occupancy and office related 373 317 56 18 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 152 (6 ) (4 %) Professional services 139 115 24 21 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 141 23 16 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,415 $ 1,354 $ 61 5 % Less non GAAP adjustments: Marketing and promotional $ $ 33 $ (33 ) (100 %) Occupancy and office related 63 12 51 425 % Technology 2 (2 ) (100 %) Professional services 12 (12 ) (100 %) Other general and administration 6 (6 ) (100 %) Total non GAAP adjustments $ 63 $ 65 $ (2 ) (3 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 295 $ 20 7 % Occupancy and office related 310 305 5 2 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 150 (4 ) (3 %) Professional services 139 103 36 35 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 135 29 21 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,352 $ 1,289 $ 63 5 % (1) Data reflects certain reclassifications of prior period data to conform to the current period presentation. General and Administration Expenses, GAAP. General and administration expenses increased $61 million, or 5%, to $1,415 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,354 million for year ended December 31, 2010. Higher occupancy and office related expenses (including $63 million of UK lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non recurrence of other general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses, GAAP was partially offset by decreases in charitable contributions and regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment. Non GAAP Adjustments. The year ended December 31, 2011 general and administration expenses included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Companys exit from two London locations. The year ended December 31, 2010 general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of marketing and promotional costs, professional services and occupancy costs. 58 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted. Excluding the UK lease exit costs and BGI integration expenses, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,352 million increased $63 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. See general and administration expenses, GAAP, above for discussion on the increase in general and administration expenses and for items offsetting the overall increase in general and administration expenses, as adjusted. In addition, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, reflected higher marketing and promotional costs in 2011. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2011, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $32 million, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs, associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. 59 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Non Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 $ Change Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (137 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) 2 (13 ) 15 Non operating income (expense)(2) (116 ) 36 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) 14 Non operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (138 ) (1) Amount includes an $18 million loss and a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Non operating expense, less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, decreased $152 million to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $36 million of net non operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 included $142 million of net interest expense, partially offset by $26 million of net positive marks primarily on private equity and real estate fund co investments, partially offset by net negative marks in distressed credit/mortgage fund co investments. Net gains on co investments and seed investments decreased $117 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due a reduction in values on distressed credit/mortgage funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds compared with an increase in values in the prior year. Net interest expense was $142 million, an increase of $21 million from the prior year. The increase reflected the May 2011 issuance of $1.5 billion of long term debt in connection with the repurchase of Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income. 60 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Income Tax Expense GAAPYear endedDecember 31, As adjustedYear endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 %Change 2011 2010 %Change Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,133 $ 3,034 3 % $ 3,279 $ 3,192 3 % Income tax expense $ 796 $ 971 (18 %) $ 1,040 $ 1,053 (1 %) Effective tax rate 25.4 % 32.0 % 31.7 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the $24 million benefit mentioned above and excluded the $198 million of net non cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The GAAP effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a $30 million non cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 excluded the $30 million non cash tax benefit mentioned above. The Companys tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 61 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(4) Amounts include acquisition adjustments and reclasses of AUM acquired from Barclays in December 2009 and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy. (5) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (6) Advisory AUM represents long term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased approximately $214.7 billion, or 6%, to $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010 from $3.346 trillion at December 31, 2009. The growth in AUM was primarily attributable to $267.0 billion in net market appreciation, $131.2 billion of net subscriptions in long term mandates and a $17.1 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $127 billion of BGI merger related outflows (due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance) and acquisition adjustments, $61.4 billion of net outflows in cash management products and $12.0 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments. Net market appreciation of $267.0 billion included $190.7 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets, $55.4 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads, $13.9 billion in multi asset class products, and $7.2 billion in alternatives, primarily due to appreciation in precious metals, including silver and gold. The $17.1 billion net increase in AUM from converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and pound sterling. 64 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Revenue $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 3,912 83 % Expenses 5,614 3,422 2,192 64 % Operating income $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,720 135 % Operating margin 34.8 % 27.2 % 7.6 % 28 % Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the full year effect of revenue and expenses related to the December 1, 2009 acquisition of BGI and $90 million of BGI integration costs compared with $183 million of BGI transaction/integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. The transaction/integration expenses were not part of BlackRocks on going business and are principally comprised of compensation expense, legal fees, advisory payments, occupancy costs, marketing and promotional and consulting expenses. The increase in the operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.2 billion net increase in operating expenses related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. The increase in the operating margin for year ended December 31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long term AUM driven by market appreciation, a $93 million decrease in BGI transaction/integration costs, a decline of $22 million in restructuring charges and a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits. Higher employee compensation and benefits expense, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses as well as increased investments to grow the business partially offset the increase in operating margin.

The increase in the operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the benefit of synergies related to the BGI Transaction and growth in long term AUM driven by market appreciation.

Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $3,464 million to $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,826 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily related to fees earned on products acquired in the BGI acquisition as well as organic growth in long term AUM due to market appreciation and net new business, which included securities lending revenue of $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees increased $338 million, or 167%, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in performance fees earned upon exceeding absolute investment or relative investment return thresholds on alternative multi strategy, fixed income and equity hedge funds and separate accounts across regional/country equity strategies, fixed income and multi asset class products. 66 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Revenue (continued) BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $17 million, or 4%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in non recurring advisory assignments, as well as the effect of a decline in advisory AUM due to distributions in portfolio liquidation assignments, which have AUM based fees, partially offset by additional Aladdin, risk management solutions and investment accounting mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $16 million from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily reflected higher AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. Other Revenue. Other revenue of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $111 million from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other revenue primarily resulted from a $52 million increase in fees, which excludes related portfolio service costs, earned for transition management services due to an increase in transactions to execute transitions of equity and fixed income mandates, a $25 million increase in marketing fees earned from Barclays for services to distribute Barclays iPath&reg; products and $12 million increase for custody fees earned on LifePath products (a portion of which is paid to a third party sub custodian and reflected within direct fund expenses). 67 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Distribution and servicing costs 408 477 (69 ) (14 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 102 100 2 2 % Direct fund expenses 493 95 398 419 % General and administration 1,354 779 575 74 % Restructuring charges 22 (22 ) (100 %) Amortization of intangible assets 160 147 13 9 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) General and administration 65 123 (58 ) (47 %) Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 (93 ) (51 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 % Restructuring charges 22 (22 ) (100 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non GAAP expense adjustments 169 292 (123 ) (42 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,445 $ 3,130 $ 2,315 74 % Total GAAP expenses increased $2,192 million, or 64%, to $5,614 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,422 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, was primarily attributable to the BGI Transaction including increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction of distribution and servicing costs. 68 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 % Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non GAAP expense adjustments 104 147 (43 ) (29 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 2,993 $ 1,655 $ 1,338 81 % Employees at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately 9,100 as compared to approximately 8,600 at December 31, 2009. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $1,338 million excluding the $43 million decrease in non GAAP adjustments primarily related to lower BGI integration costs. The $1,338 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to a $721 million increase in incentive compensation and a $617 million increase in salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, temporary help and commissions. The increase in incentive compensation is primarily associated with the increase in operating income after excluding the BGI integration costs, a $132 million increase in stock based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010. The $617 million increase in salaries, benefits and payroll taxes reflected an increase in the number of employees primarily resulting from the BGI Transaction as well as growth in number of employees subsequent to the BGI Transaction. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $69 million to $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $69 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of distribution payments due to lower levels of average cash management AUM and a decrease of costs due to an increase in advisory fee waivers for certain cash management funds serviced by Merrill Lynch. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $246 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $10 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $349 million and $19 million of costs, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2009. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $43 million to $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $2 million to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $398 million primarily related to the addition of legacy BGI funds subject to arrangements under which BlackRock pays certain fund expenses. 69 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change General and administration expenses(1), GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 328 $ 85 $ 243 286 % Occupancy and office related 317 182 135 74 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 152 114 38 33 % Professional services 115 162 (47 ) (29 %) Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 141 101 40 40 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,354 $ 779 $ 575 74 % Less BGI transaction and integration costs: Marketing and promotional $ 33 $ 11 $ 22 200 % Occupancy and office related 12 1 11 * Technology 2 7 (5 ) (71 %) Professional services 12 91 (79 ) (87 %) Other general and administration 6 13 (7 ) (54 %) Total BGI transaction and integration costs $ 65 $ 123 $ (58 ) (47 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 295 $ 74 $ 221 299 % Occupancy and office related 305 181 124 69 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 150 107 43 40 % Professional services 103 71 32 45 % Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 135 88 47 53 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,289 $ 656 $ 633 96 % * Not applicable.

General and administration expenses increased $575 million, or 74%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 from the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the BGI Transaction. BGI Transaction and Integration Costs. BGI integration costs of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $58 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to advisory and legal costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by higher re branding costs in 2010. 70 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted Marketing and promotional expenses increased $221 million, primarily due to an increase in global and exchange traded fund marketing expenses, which included travel, promotional and rebranding and advertising expenses. Occupancy and office related expenses increased $124 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction, including expenses related to Drapers Gardens and an increase in lease impairments as a result of vacating certain locations in the year ended December 31, 2010. Portfolio service costs increased $77 million, due to an increase in market data and research expenses as well as transition management execution and clearing expenses. Technology expenses increased $43 million primarily due to an increase in software licensing and maintenance and hardware depreciation expenses. Professional services increased $32 million primarily related to consulting, accounting/tax and legal costs. Communications increased $23 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction. Regulatory, filing and license fees increased $29 million primarily due to a $20 million U.K. regulatory assessment. Charitable contributions increased $24 million, which is primarily related to a contribution to a donor advised charitable fund. Closed end fund launch costs (excluding compensation costs) increased $13 million due to the Build America Bond Trust fund, which launched during the year ended December 31, 2010 and generated approximately $1.2 billion in AUM. Other general and administration expenses increased $47 million due to an increase of $86 million related to growth of the Company including recruiting, training and insurance costs, as well as costs for potential operating errors/fines, partially offset by a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits from $11 million of costs in the year ended December 31, 2009 to a $6 million benefit in the year ended December 31, 2010, a $9 million decline in an expense for a potentially uncollectible receivable recorded in 2009 and $9 million of lower provisions related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2009, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $22 million primarily related to severance, outplacement costs, occupancy costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased $13 million to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in amortization of intangible assets reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction. 71 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 Non Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 $ Change Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ 23 $ (6 ) $ 29 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) (13 ) 22 (35 ) Non operating income (expense)(2) 36 (28 ) 64 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (11 ) (18 ) 7 Non operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ 25 $ (46 ) $ 71 (1) Amount includes a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $36 million non operating income, net of non controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010 was comprised of $146 million of net gains on co investments and seed investments and $11 million of appreciation related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $121 million of net interest expense. Net gain on co investments and seed investments increased $144 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the non recurrence of 2009 valuation declines in real estate equity and debt co investments. Net interest expense was $121 million, an increase of $73 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the December 2009 issuances of $2.5 billion of long term notes, partially offset by higher dividend income related to an investment required for regulatory purposes. 72 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Income Tax Expense Year endedDecember 31, %Change Year endedDecember 31, %Change 2010 2009 2010 2009 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,034 $ 1,250 143 % $ 3,192 $ 1,524 109 % Income tax expense $ 971 $ 375 159 % $ 1,053 $ 503 109 % Effective tax rate 32.0 % 30.0 % 33.0 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.

As adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 excluded $45 million of non cash benefits due to legislation enacted primarily with respect to New York City corporate income taxes. The Company succeeded to a $580 million California net operating loss carryforward for fiscal year 2007, 2008 and 2009 in connection with the BGI Transaction, for which it has not recorded a deferred income tax asset because of certain technical matters related to the predecessors unitary tax returns. The Company will continue to assess these matters, which may result in future tax benefits which, based on current factors, could approximate $40 million, if they are resolved favorably. 73 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(continued) As Adjusted. Exclusive of the items discussed above, net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. as adjusted, totaled $2,139 million or 10.94 per diluted common share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was an increase of $1,118 million or $3.81 per diluted earnings per common share from the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)) or cash flows. Management reviews its as adjusted balance sheet, a non GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock consolidated five VIEs. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. 75 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) December 31, 2011 Segregated client assetsgenerating advisory fees inwhich BlackRock has noeconomic interest orliability (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis SeparateAccountAssets/Collateral ConsolidatedVIEs ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds AsAdjusted Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ $ $ 196 $ 3,310 Accounts receivable 1,960 1,960 Investments 1,631 112 1,519 Assets of consolidated variable interest entities 1,693 1,693 Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 Other assets(1) 1,169 5 1,164 Sub total 149,748 139,789 1,693 313 7,953 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,148 30,148 Total assets $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits $ 1,383 $ $ $ $ 1,383 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 923 923 Borrowings(2) 4,790 4,790 Liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 1,583 1,583 Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 Deferred income tax liabilities 5,323 5,323 Other liabilities(3) 743 37 706 Total liabilities 154,534 139,789 1,583 37 13,125 Equity Total stockholders equity 25,048 72 24,976 Non controlling interests 314 38 276 Total equity 25,362 110 276 24,976 Total liabilities and equity $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 (1) Amount includes due from related parties, deferred sales commissions, property and equipment and other assets.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. These changes do not include assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRocks stockholders equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $196 million and $65 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2011. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 decreased $135 million from December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting lower performance fees receivables at December 31, 2011 partially offset by higher receivables related to securities lending revenue. 77 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are owned by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, consolidated even though BlackRock may not own the majority of any such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of non controlling interests, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc. The Company further presents total net economic investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as generally there is no impact to BlackRocks stockholders equity as the balance fluctuates. Finally, the Companys regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Companys net economic investment exposure.

Total investments, as adjusted, at December 31, 2011 increased $116 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from $457 million of purchases/capital contributions, $9 million of positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $8 million of net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially offset by $280 million of sales/maturities and $78 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Companys investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, for total GAAP investments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2011 decreased $169 million from December 31, 2010, primarily due to $156 million of amortization expense related to finite lived intangibles. Other Assets. Other assets at December 31, 2011 increased $209 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from a $109 million increase in property and equipment due to additional leasehold improvements and equipment, including capital expenditures related to the lease of U.K. office space located at Drapers Gardens, and a $51 million increase in tax receivables. Accrued Compensation and Benefits. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 decreased $137 million from December 31, 2010 primarily related to lower 2011 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $145 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from decreases in current income taxes payable and unit trust payables. Borrowings. Borrowings at December 31, 2011 increased $1,431 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from net proceeds from new issuances of long term borrowings of $1,496 million, partially offset by conversions of the final $67 million of convertible debt. Deferred Income Tax Liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $154 million primarily as a result of revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to a state tax election, enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local legislation. In addition, the decrease included the effects of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income. Other Liabilities. Other liabilities at December 31, 2011 increased $102 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from an accrual for U.K. lease exit costs, increases in deferred carried interest and liabilities of consolidated funds, partially offset by repayments to Barclays to settle certain non interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and a payment related to a U.K. regulatory assessment. Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity at December 31, 2011 decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2010, principally resulting from $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion to repurchase Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock and $497 million of stock based compensation expense. 79 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: Year ended December 31, 2011 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ $ 3,302 Cash flows from operating activities 2,826 42 136 2,648 Cash flows from investing activities (204 ) 24 (228 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,485 ) 65 (136 ) (2,414 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2 2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 139 131 8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,506 $ 196 $ $ 3,310 Year ended December 31, 2010 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 4,708 $ 75 $ 9 $ 4,624 Cash flows from operating activities 2,488 (76 ) (1 ) 2,565 Cash flows from investing activities (627 ) (52 ) (575 ) Cash flows from financing activities (3,170 ) 118 (8 ) (3,280 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (32 ) (32 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,341 ) (10 ) (9 ) (1,322 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ $ 3,302 80 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities. Sources of BlackRocks operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Companys borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRocks capital stock, capital expenditures and to purchase co investments and seed investments. Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Investing Activities. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $228 million and primarily included $247 million of purchases of property and equipment and $262 million of purchases of investments, partially offset by $247 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $34 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Financing Activities. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,414 million, which included $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion related to the repurchase of Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million for employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments and $67 million for convertible debt repayments. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $1,496 million of net proceeds from long term borrowings and $56 million of other inflows including excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and proceeds from stock option exercises. Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ 3,367 $ 139 4 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (196 ) (65 ) (131 ) (202 %) Subtotal 3,310 3,302 8 % 2011 credit facility undrawn 3,400 3,400 * 2007 credit facility undrawn(2) 2,266 (2,266 ) (100 %) Total liquidity $ 6,710 $ 5,568 $ 1,142 21 % Required regulatory capital(3) $ 1,196 $ 897 $ 299 33 % * Not applicable. (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. (2) Amount excludes $134 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2010 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. The 2007 credit facility was terminated in March 2011. (3) A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents. Total liquidity improved by $1,142 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily reflecting the additional borrowing capacity under the 2011 credit facility compared with the 2007 credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Companys net capital requirements increased $299 million due to increases related to certain European and Asia Pacific regulated legal entities. A significant portion of the Companys $1,519 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. 81 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term borrowings The following describes the Companys short term borrowing arrangements, which the Company has access to utilize. 2011 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2011 credit facility), which replaced the 2007 facility. The 2011 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2011 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. The 2011 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of approximately 1 to 1 at December 31, 2011. The 2011 credit facility provides back up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Barclays has a $255 million participation under the 2011 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the CP Program) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances during 2011 were used to fund a portion of the repurchase of BlackRocks Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program from $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2011 credit facility. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Share Repurchase Approvals. In July 2010, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) approved the repurchase of up to 5,100,000 shares to neutralize the dilutive effects of restricted stock units and options that have been granted to employees that will become dilutive over the next several years. The shares are to be repurchased with management discretion on the timing of the repurchases. The Company repurchased 618,000 shares in open market transactions for approximately $100 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had repurchased approximately 1,514,000 shares and there were 3,586,000 shares still authorized to be repurchased. In February 2012, the Board approved an increase in the availability under the Companys existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds. Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria are met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. At December 31, 2011, Barclays remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. 82 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2011, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1,196 million in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC and entities regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom, and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $1,516 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Companys current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ $ $ $ $ $ 100 Long term borrowings: Principal 500 750 1,000 2,450 4,700 Interest 180 169 161 126 126 353 1,115 Operating leases 120 131 121 110 99 814 1,395 Purchase obligations 101 80 65 22 11 279 Investment commitments 112 112 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,113 1,130 1,347 258 236 3,617 7,701 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 194 194 388 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(1) $ 1,307 $ 1,324 $ 1,347 $ 258 $ 236 $ 3,617 $ 8,089 (1) As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $281 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. 83 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Short term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2011 credit facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Long term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the principal amount of long term borrowings was $4.7 billion. Debt service and repayment requirements are $680 million in 2012, $919 million in 2013, $1,161 million in 2014, $126 million in 2015 and 2016. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2012, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes of approximately $96 million per year is payable semi annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRocks Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) is payable semi annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011 and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (2013 Floating Rate Notes) is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Companys option before maturity. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of the obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that currently expire through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2011, the Companys obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office related services and third party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $112 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment and are, therefore, presented in 2012. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Claw back. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive certain carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimated payments for 2012, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2013. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13, Stock Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 totaled $1,383 million and included incentive compensation of $1,079 million, deferred compensation of $91 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $213 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2012, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $118.9 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications. In many of the Companys contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Acquisitions. In January 2012, BlackRock announced that it has agreed to acquire Toronto based Claymore Investments, Inc. (Claymore), subject to customary closing conditions. Claymore is a wholly owned independent Canadian subsidiary of Guggenheim Funds Services Group, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC. The total consideration estimated to be paid at closing will be approximately $210 million. 85 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively investment products) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (VIE) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (PB) of the investment product, which would require consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Pursuant to ASC 810 10, certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. ASU 2010 10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010 10) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010 10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010 10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related parties, is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010 10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010 10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2011, the Company consolidated five VIEs, including four CLOs and one sponsored private equity fund. 86 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) At December 31, 2011, the following balances related to the five VIEs consolidated on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 47 $ 7 $ 54 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,608 31 1,639 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,574 ) (1,574 ) Other liabilities (9 ) (9 ) Appropriated retained earnings (72 ) (72 ) Non controlling interests of consolidated VIEs (38 ) (38 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ $ $ As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities, including the four aforementioned CLOs in which BlackRock, in accordance with ASU 2009 17, was determined to be the PB, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1,655 million and $1,583 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. The changes in the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRocks consent as the general partner of the fund. At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded $7 million, $31 million and $38 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. 87 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810 20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810 20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 196 $ 65 Investments: Trading investments 214 60 Other investments 373 337 Other assets 5 3 Other liabilities (37 ) (10 ) Non controlling interests (276 ) (195 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 475 $ 260 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810 10. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 88 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had $583 million and $58 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale, held to maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other than temporary. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 89 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820 10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (NAVs), which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, and public equities and certain exchange traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAVs where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as overthe counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAVs and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. Level 3 assets in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans. 90 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs (continued) Level 3 inputs include the most currently available information, including capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRocks $702 million of Level 3 investments or 43% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2011 primarily included the above mentioned co investments. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third party sources; however, in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. Level 3 liabilities in this category include borrowings of CLOs valued based upon non binding single broker quotes. Significance of Inputs. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Pricing Services and Broker Quotes. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from well recognized third party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock reviews both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Significant Transfers Into and Out of Levels 1, 2, and 3. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $47 million of net investments out of Level 3 predominantly to Level 2. The majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account) and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,116 million of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense), $52 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $442 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $21 million related to carried interest has no impact on non operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2011, changes in fair value of approximately $587 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRocks net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $475 million. 91 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Goodwill $ 12,792 $ 12,805 Intangible assets Indefinitelived Management contracts 15,188 15,188 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 1,403 License 6 6 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts 755 911 Other 4 4 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,148 $ 30,317 The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open and closed end investment funds as well as collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2011, ranged from 2 years to 13 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 5.4 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2011 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2011 the Companys common stock closed at $178.24, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $140.07 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite lived and finite lived intangibles. The Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate fair values have declined below their respective carrying amounts on a quarterly basis. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in the Companys business, financial results, legal or regulatory environment, the loss of key personnel, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which include a review of all significant assumptions, that would be used to value the asset, to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired. The Company performs such assessments of its intangible assets at least annually. In its assessment of management contracts and trade names/trademarks, the Company considers various factors, including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates to determine whether the carrying values of each intangible asset unit of account are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. 92 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Indefinite lived and finite lived intangibles (continued) If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite lived intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $156 million, $160 million and $147 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite lived versus finite lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock had $349 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $226 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $6 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,323 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. 93 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $110 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $108 million and current income taxes payable of $102 million at December 31, 2011. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605 45, Revenue Recognition Principle Agent Considerations (ASC 605 45), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $928 million, $831 million and $611 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, securities lending revenue totaled $397 million, $325 million and $36 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. 94 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, performance fee revenue totaled $371 million, $540 million and $202 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $33 million and $23 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $510 million, $460 million and $477 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. 95 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Amendments to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04), which amends the existing fair value guidance within ASC 820. The amendments include: (1) application of the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets (that is, it does not apply to financial assets or any liabilities), (2) an exception to fair value measurement principles for financial assets and financial liabilities (and derivatives) with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk, which allows an entity to measure the fair value of the net risk position, when several criteria are met, (3) extension of the prohibition of a blockage factor application to all fair value measurements, (4) a model for the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entitys shareholders equity which is consistent with the guidance of measuring the fair value for liabilities, (5) additional disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, (ii) a description of the valuation processes used by the entity and (iii) a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements, (6) disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed and (7) disclosure of any transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, not just significant transfers. The provisions of ASU 2011 04 are effective for the Company for the interim period beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to materially impact BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. Amendments to Goodwill Impairment Testing. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011 08), which amends the guidance in ASC 350 on testing goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test). If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than the carrying amount, the two step impairment test would be required. The amendments are effective for the Company for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning after December 15, 2011. The provisions of SU 2011 08, if elected to be adopted, are not expected to materially impact BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. 96 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRocks investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2011, the majority of the Companys investment advisory and administration fees was based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $43 million. 97 Table of Contents Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks (continued) At December 31, 2011, approximately $587 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Companys economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,631 $ 1,540 $ 91 6 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (587 ) (397 ) (190 ) (48 %) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 475 260 215 83 % Total investments, as adjusted 1,519 1,403 116 8 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (328 ) (325 ) (3 ) (1 %) Carried interest (21 ) (13 ) (8 ) (62 %) Deferred compensation investments (65 ) (76 ) 11 14 % Hedged investments (43 ) (25 ) (18 ) (72 %) Total economic investment exposure $ 1,062 $ 964 $ 98 10 % The economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Companys net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $596 million of the Companys total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and fund of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $59.6 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $466 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $3 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro was $152 million. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $15.2 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 98 Table of Contents

Management reviews non GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks financial performance over time. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Computations for all periods are derived from the Companys consolidated statements of income as follows: (a) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income, as adjusted, equals operating income, GAAP basis, excluding certain items management deems non recurring, or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value, as indicated in the table below. Operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Operating margin, as adjusted, equals operating income used for operating margin measurement, divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement, as indicated in the table below. Year ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating income, GAAP basis $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 1,278 Non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 General and administration 65 123 Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 UK lease exit costs 63 Restructuring charges 32 22 PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 59 Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 10 Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 18 Operating income, as adjusted 3,392 3,167 1,570 Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 2 Closed end fund launch commissions 3 2 1 Operating income used for operating margin measurement $ 3,421 $ 3,184 $ 1,573 Revenue, GAAP basis $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 4,700 Non GAAP adjustments: Distribution and servicing costs (386 ) (408 ) (477 ) Amortization of deferred sales commissions (81 ) (102 ) (100 ) Revenue used for operating margin measurement $ 8,614 $ 8,102 $ 4,123 Operating margin, GAAP basis 35.8 % 34.8 % 27.2 % Operating margin, as adjusted 39.7 % 39.3 % 38.2 % Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRocks financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. 41 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) Operating income, as adjusted: BGI transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense, legal fees, marketing and promotional, occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the BGI acquisition from Barclays. Restructuring charges recorded in 2011 and 2009 consisted of compensation costs and professional fees. Restructuring charges in 2009 also included occupancy costs. UK lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in London in the third quarter 2011. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long term incentive plans (LTIP) that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact BlackRocks book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non operating income (expense). Management believes operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRocks operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Operating margin, as adjusted: Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Companys results until future periods. Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period to period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in non operating income., Examples of such adjustments include restructuring charges, BGI transaction and integration costs, UK lease exit costs, closed end fund launch costs, commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark to market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non GAAP financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of BlackRock. The non GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the Companys revenues and expenses. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues. 42 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (b) Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, as adjusted: Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests (NCI), as adjusted, equals non operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non operating income (expense), GAAP basis. Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (6 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI 2 (13 ) 22 Non operating income (expense) (1) (116 ) 36 (28 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) (18 ) Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (46 ) (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests. Management believes non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRocks non operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, substantially offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRocks non operating results that impact book value. 43 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) (c) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRocks profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRocks book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, adjustments primarily related to a state tax election and certain enacted UK, Japan, US state and local tax legislation, which resulted in the re measurement of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting increase or decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability for periods presented. (d) For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 non GAAP adjustments were tax effected at 31.8%, 33% and 30%, respectively, which reflects the blended rate applicable to the adjustments. (e) Non voting participating preferred shares are considered to be common stock equivalents for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Certain unvested restricted stock units are not included in this number as they are deemed participating securities in accordance with required provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 260 10, Earnings per Share. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 average outstanding participating securities were 1.8 million, 2.8 million and 3.8 million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock has portfolio managers located around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Germany. The Company provides a wide array of products, including passively and actively managed equities, fixed income, multi asset class, cash management and alternatives. BlackRock offers clients diversified access to global markets through separate accounts, collective investment trusts, open end and closed end mutual funds, exchange traded products, hedge funds, and funds of funds. BlackRock provides global advisory services for private investment funds and retail products. The Companys non U.S. investment funds are based in a number of domiciles and cover a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, cash management and alternatives. In the United States retail offerings include various open end and closed end funds, including iShares, the global product leader in exchange traded products for institutional, retail and high net worth investors. There are 504 iShares products globally across equities, fixed income and commodities, which trade like common stocks on 20 exchanges worldwide. iShares AUM totaled $593.4 billion at December 31, 2011. The BlackRock Global Funds, the Companys primary retail fund group offered outside the United States, are authorized for distribution in 35 jurisdictions worldwide. Additional fund offerings include structured products, real estate funds, hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds and funds of funds, managed futures funds and exchange funds. These products are sold to both U.S. and non U.S. high net worth, retail and institutional investors in a wide variety of active and passive strategies covering both equity and fixed income assets. BlackRocks client base consists of financial institutions and other corporate clients, pension plans, charities, official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranational authorities and other government entities, high net worth individuals and retail investors around the world. BlackRock maintains a significant sales and marketing presence both inside and outside the United States that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals, pension consultants and establishing third party distribution relationships. BlackRock also distributes its products and services through Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are met. BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. BlackRock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimums generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between BlackRock and the funds or other third party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees, based upon relative and or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of BlackRocks revenue and earnings. Historically, the magnitude of performance fees in the third and fourth quarters generally exceeds the first two calendar quarters in a year due to the greater number of products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31. 45 Table of Contents Overview (continued) Financial Highlights (continued) BlackRock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. These services are provided under the brand name BlackRock Solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. Approximately $10 trillion of positions are processed on the Companys Aladdin operating platform, which serves as the investment/ risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. Through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. BlackRock is also able to service these clients via its Aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures. The Company earns fees for transition management services comprised of commissions from acting as an introducing broker dealer in buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur. Operating expenses reflect employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses and amortization of finite lived intangible assets. Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes and related benefit costs. Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments made to Merrill Lynch affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain BlackRock products. Direct fund expenses primarily consist of third party non advisory expenses incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expenses, audit and tax services as well as other fund related expenses directly attributable to the non advisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. General and administration expenses include marketing and promotional, occupancy and office related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expenses related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed end fund launch costs and other general and administration expenses, including foreign currency remeasurement costs. Non operating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available for sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments, as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. Other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available for sale investments. BlackRock primarily holds seed and co investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, distressed credit/mortgage debt securities, hedge funds and real estate. Investments generally are made for co investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans, or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. BlackRock does not engage in proprietary trading or other investment activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. In addition, non operating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligations. The portion of non operating income (expense) not attributable to BlackRock is allocated to non controlling interests on the consolidated statements of income. 46 Table of Contents Assets Under Management AUM for reporting purposes is generally based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

(4) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (5) Advisory AUM represents long term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM decreased approximately $48.3 billion, or 1%, to $3.513 trillion at December 31, 2011 from $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010. The decline in AUM was primarily attributable to $34.6 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines, $29.9 billion of advisory distributions and $22.9 billion of cash management net outflows, partially offset by $67.3 billion of long term net new business, before giving effect to the final BGI merger related outflows of $28.3 billion recorded in the first half of 2011. Net market depreciation of $27.5 billion included $128.1 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of $100.7 billion. The $7.1 billion net decrease in AUM from converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, pound sterling and Canadian dollar, partially offset by weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Business Outlook The diversity of the Companys business model, which offers a significant breadth of asset classes along with alpha and beta management styles, and its global reach, allows BlackRock to capture asset flows as investor sentiment shifts. BlackRock finished 2011 with strong index flows as clients continued to rebalance their portfolios from active products due to volatile market conditions. BlackRock expects such conditions to continue into 2012 due to the European sovereign debt crisis, global political elections in 2012, and continued unrest in the Middle East. 49 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) In early 2012, BlackRock continues to see signs of economic strength in the U.S. as the pace of expansion accelerates and the unemployment rate declines. During 2012, BlackRock expects emerging economies to outperform, while the U.S. and Japan grow at lower rates and Europe faces a slow economic recovery. BlackRock will actively monitor global monetary policies (including quantitative easing and the direction of interest rates), bank lending policies, the Euro crisis, global political elections, and the U.S. debt ceiling and housing market along with the effects on global corporate earnings growth. The Company offers a broad range of equity, fixed income, multi asset and alternative products designed to track various indices, target returns in excess of specified benchmarks or focus on absolute returns. BlackRocks broad set of product offerings, risk skills and tools allow the Company to work with clients in meeting their investment objectives over both short and long term horizons. While investing for stable income continues to be a core objective of many clients, BlackRock expects clients to trend towards indexing, retirement and income, alternatives and multi asset class solutions along with risk management tools and advisory services. The following items could impact the Companys results in 2012 and beyond: AUM and Flows As investors shift preferences between asset classes, and active and passive investment styles, the Companys broad product profile, including a wide array of offerings in asset types and management styles, should enable it to retain and capture revenue. As equity markets improve and with no sign of rising interest rates from their historic lows in the near term, BlackRock expects clients who in the latter half of 2011 were delaying investment decisions, to re risk into beta and alpha equity and alternative products. BlackRocks unique combination of index and active capabilities positions it well to assist companies in narrowing the gap on underfunded pension plans by implementing barbell strategies using a combination of index, alpha and alternative products. In addition, as retirement money moves away from defined benefit plans into defined contributions plans and ultimately to individuals, BlackRock is well positioned to offer individual investment options with its LifePath&reg; target date portfolios and wide array of ETFs and other mutual fund products. BlackRock has a leading global market share in exchange traded products (ETP) due to its large array of products and AUM in this market. The global growth of the ETP market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid ask spread), tax efficiency, transparency and client service. Industry asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra low interest rates, industry flows shifted toward fixed income oriented products and, within equities, to developed markets and away from broad and single country emerging market funds. Additional asset managers may enter the marketplace and offer similar exchange traded products at lower fee structures; however, the Company believes that many factors beyond pricing influence investor preferences. BlackRock believes alternative products will become more important for both institutional and retail clients to invest in alpha generating products to generate higher returns. The Company significantly invested in its alternatives platform during 2011 for products expected to be introduced in 2012, which will invest in private equity, renewable power, real estate as well as other opportunistic asset classes. Cash management assets may continue to decline from year end levels if clients begin to re risk their portfolios in search of yield or equity return opportunities as rates remain low, including those in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve currently expects U.S. rates to remain low until 2014. The Companys diversified global product offerings, client service and independent advice may enable it to retain a portion of these assets. Regulatory Reform The regulatory environment in 2011 continued to evolve for financial institutions as well as money market funds with the intent of the reform supported by BlackRock, to protect the industry and our clients. Regulatory reform continues to evolve and may affect the competitive environment, including liquidity and trading costs, and may provide BlackRock and its clients with risks as well as opportunities. 50 Table of Contents Business Outlook (continued) Performance fees and BRS/advisory fees While most of BlackRocks absolute return AUM products eligible for performance fees are marginally below high water marks, a return to higher market levels may enable the Companys alternative investment products to contribute additional performance fee revenue. The sovereign uncertainty in 2011 across Europe and an increasing focus on risk management led to unique opportunities for BlackRocks risk tools and advisory services, combining the Companys extensive capital markets and structuring expertise with rigorous modeling and analytical capabilities across an increasingly global client base. In 2012, the Company expects continuing strong global demand for its Aladdin operating platform and its comprehensive risk reporting from sophisticated institutional investors and governmental agencies investing in longer term risk management solutions as well as strong demand for financial market advisory services. Future opportunities The Company plans to continue to invest in its people, its platform and its global BlackRock brand. In addition, it will build out key products and geographic locations as well as an internal trading platform on its enterprise systems to cross trades within its platform and potentially among other client transactions, which is expected to result in lower portfolio transaction costs and ultimately increased performance returns for clients. 51 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Revenue $ 9,081 $ 8,612 $ 469 5 % Expenses 5,832 5,614 218 4 % Operating income $ 3,249 $ 2,998 $ 251 8 % Operating margin 35.8 % 34.8 % 1.0 % 3 % The increase in operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was attributable to the $469 million increase in revenue primarily due to higher base fees associated with growth in long term average AUM, which included the benefit of higher average markets and the benefit of net new business, and higher BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower performance fees. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a $218 million net increase in operating expenses related to business growth, including an increase in the number of employees, professional fees and average long dated AUM growth, which affects certain expenses, including direct fund expenses. In addition, operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Companys exit from two London locations and $32 million of restructuring charges. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $90 million of BGI integration costs. Each of these items are excluded from the as adjusted results below.

The increase was partially offset by a $169 million decrease in performance fees primarily reflecting lower fees from hedge funds and a $16 million decrease in distribution fees. 53 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Revenue (continued) Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $606 million to $7,896 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This growth primarily reflected growth in average long term AUM, which included the benefit of net new business, partially offset by a decline in fees from cash management products due to lower average AUM and higher fee waivers. Securities lending fees were $397 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $325 million for year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan and higher lending rates.

The decrease was partially offset by higher performance fees due to strong relative performance from regional/country and global equity strategies. BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $50 million, or 11%, from the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to on going and additional Aladdin mandates and advisory assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $16 million from $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to lower AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. 55 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Distribution and servicing costs 386 408 (22 ) (5 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 81 102 (21 ) (21 %) Direct fund expenses 563 493 70 14 % General and administration 1,415 1,354 61 5 % Restructuring charges 32 32 * Amortization of intangible assets 156 160 (4 ) (3 %) Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,832 $ 5,614 $ 218 4 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 (25 ) (100 %) General and administration 65 (65 ) (100 %) Total BGI integration costs 90 (90 ) (100 %) UK lease exit costs 63 63 * Restructuring charges 32 32 * PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non GAAP expense adjustments 143 169 (26 ) (15 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,689 $ 5,445 $ 244 4 % * Not applicable.

Excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $244 million, or 4%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, is primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits, direct fund expenses and general and administration expenses, partially offset by a reduction in distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions. 56 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,199 $ 3,097 $ 102 3 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI integration costs 25 (25 ) (100 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 44 58 (14 ) (24 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 7 10 (3 ) (30 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans (3 ) 11 (14 ) * Total non GAAP expense adjustments 48 104 (56 ) (54 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 3,151 $ 2,993 $ 158 5 % * Not applicable. Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $102 million, or 3%, to $3,199 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $3,097 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Employees at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 10,100 as compared to approximately 9,100 at December 31, 2010. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $158 million, reflecting a $164 million increase in base salaries due to an increase in the number of employees and salary levels, and a $41 million increase in other compensation, including payroll taxes, benefits, and commissions. These increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease in incentive compensation. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $22 million to $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $22 million decrease related to lower cash management related costs of $45 million, reflecting lower average AUM and higher yield support waivers resulting in lower levels of distribution costs, partially offset by higher costs due to increases in average AUM for open end and closed end funds, separate accounts and variable annuities. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $207 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $3 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates as compared to $246 million and $10 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2010. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $24 million to $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $21 million to $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lower sales in certain share classes of U.S. open end mutual funds contributed to the decline. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $70 million reflecting growth in average AUM for the funds (predominately iShares) where BlackRock pays certain non advisory expenses of the funds. 57 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 Amount % Change General and administration expenses, GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 328 $ (13 ) (4 %) Occupancy and office related 373 317 56 18 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 152 (6 ) (4 %) Professional services 139 115 24 21 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 141 23 16 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,415 $ 1,354 $ 61 5 % Less non GAAP adjustments: Marketing and promotional $ $ 33 $ (33 ) (100 %) Occupancy and office related 63 12 51 425 % Technology 2 (2 ) (100 %) Professional services 12 (12 ) (100 %) Other general and administration 6 (6 ) (100 %) Total non GAAP adjustments $ 63 $ 65 $ (2 ) (3 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 315 $ 295 $ 20 7 % Occupancy and office related 310 305 5 2 % Portfolio services 189 177 12 7 % Technology 146 150 (4 ) (3 %) Professional services 139 103 36 35 % Communications 40 49 (9 ) (18 %) Regulatory, filing and license fees 16 34 (18 ) (53 %) Charitable contributions 7 26 (19 ) (73 %) Closed end fund launch costs 26 15 11 73 % Other general and administration 164 135 29 21 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,352 $ 1,289 $ 63 5 % (1) Data reflects certain reclassifications of prior period data to conform to the current period presentation.

Higher occupancy and office related expenses (including $63 million of UK lease exit costs), higher professional services costs and other general and administration expenses contributed to the overall net increase in general and administration expenses. The $23 million increase in other general and administration expenses reflected higher VAT expense and recruiting costs in 2011 offset by the non recurrence of other general and administration provisions recorded in 2010 related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. The increase in general and administration expenses, GAAP was partially offset by decreases in charitable contributions and regulatory, filing and licenses fees, primarily due to a $20 million 2010 U.K. industry regulatory assessment. Non GAAP Adjustments. The year ended December 31, 2011 general and administration expenses included $63 million of UK lease exit costs related to the Companys exit from two London locations. The year ended December 31, 2010 general and administration expenses included $65 million of BGI integration costs primarily consisting of marketing and promotional costs, professional services and occupancy costs. 58 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted. Excluding the UK lease exit costs and BGI integration expenses, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, of $1,352 million increased $63 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. See general and administration expenses, GAAP, above for discussion on the increase in general and administration expenses and for items offsetting the overall increase in general and administration expenses, as adjusted. In addition, general and administration expenses, as adjusted, reflected higher marketing and promotional costs in 2011. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2011, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $32 million, primarily related to severance, accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards, and legal and outplacement costs, associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. 59 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 Non Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 $ Change Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ (114 ) $ 23 $ (137 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) 2 (13 ) 15 Non operating income (expense)(2) (116 ) 36 (152 ) Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans 3 (11 ) 14 Non operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ (113 ) $ 25 $ (138 ) (1) Amount includes an $18 million loss and a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Non operating expense, less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, decreased $152 million to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with $36 million of net non operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 included $142 million of net interest expense, partially offset by $26 million of net positive marks primarily on private equity and real estate fund co investments, partially offset by net negative marks in distressed credit/mortgage fund co investments. Net gains on co investments and seed investments decreased $117 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due a reduction in values on distressed credit/mortgage funds and hedge funds/funds of hedge funds compared with an increase in values in the prior year. Net interest expense was $142 million, an increase of $21 million from the prior year. The increase reflected the May 2011 issuance of $1.5 billion of long term debt in connection with the repurchase of Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income. 60 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Income Tax Expense GAAPYear endedDecember 31, As adjustedYear endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2011 2010 %Change 2011 2010 %Change Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,133 $ 3,034 3 % $ 3,279 $ 3,192 3 % Income tax expense $ 796 $ 971 (18 %) $ 1,040 $ 1,053 (1 %) Effective tax rate 25.4 % 32.0 % 31.7 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the $24 million benefit mentioned above and excluded the $198 million of net non cash tax benefits due to a state tax election and enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local tax legislation. The GAAP effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a $30 million non cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain net deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets due to enacted U.K. tax legislation. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2010 included the effect of favorable tax rulings and the resolution of certain outstanding tax positions. The as adjusted effective tax rate of 33.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 excluded the $30 million non cash tax benefit mentioned above. The Companys tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions, which have lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada and the Netherlands. U.S. income taxes were not provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. 61 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with the year ended December 31, 2010 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(4) Amounts include acquisition adjustments and reclasses of AUM acquired from Barclays in December 2009 and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy. (5) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. (6) Advisory AUM represents long term portfolio liquidation assignments. AUM increased approximately $214.7 billion, or 6%, to $3.561 trillion at December 31, 2010 from $3.346 trillion at December 31, 2009. The growth in AUM was primarily attributable to $267.0 billion in net market appreciation, $131.2 billion of net subscriptions in long term mandates and a $17.1 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements, partially offset by $127 billion of BGI merger related outflows (due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance) and acquisition adjustments, $61.4 billion of net outflows in cash management products and $12.0 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments. Net market appreciation of $267.0 billion included $190.7 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets, $55.4 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads, $13.9 billion in multi asset class products, and $7.2 billion in alternatives, primarily due to appreciation in precious metals, including silver and gold. The $17.1 billion net increase in AUM from converting non U.S. dollar denominated AUM into U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and pound sterling. 64 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Operating Income and Operating Margin Overview GAAP Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Revenue $ 8,612 $ 4,700 $ 3,912 83 % Expenses 5,614 3,422 2,192 64 % Operating income $ 2,998 $ 1,278 $ 1,720 135 % Operating margin 34.8 % 27.2 % 7.6 % 28 % Operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the full year effect of revenue and expenses related to the December 1, 2009 acquisition of BGI and $90 million of BGI integration costs compared with $183 million of BGI transaction/integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. The transaction/integration expenses were not part of BlackRocks on going business and are principally comprised of compensation expense, legal fees, advisory payments, occupancy costs, marketing and promotional and consulting expenses. The increase in the operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to the $3.9 billion increase in revenue primarily related to an increase in base and performance fees associated with the AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction and growth in long term AUM, which included market appreciation and net new business, partially offset by a $2.2 billion net increase in operating expenses related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. The increase in the operating margin for year ended December 31, 2010 included the positive effects of synergies related to the BGI Transaction, growth in long term AUM driven by market appreciation, a $93 million decrease in BGI transaction/integration costs, a decline of $22 million in restructuring charges and a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits. Higher employee compensation and benefits expense, general and administrative expenses and direct fund expenses as well as increased investments to grow the business partially offset the increase in operating margin.

The increase was partially offset by a $2.3 billion net increase in operating expenses, primarily related to increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses due to the BGI Transaction. The increase in the operating margin, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the benefit of synergies related to the BGI Transaction and growth in long term AUM driven by market appreciation.

Investment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues increased $3,464 million to $7,290 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,826 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily related to fees earned on products acquired in the BGI acquisition as well as organic growth in long term AUM due to market appreciation and net new business, which included securities lending revenue of $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Performance Fees. Investment advisory performance fees increased $338 million, or 167%, to $540 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $202 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in performance fees earned upon exceeding absolute investment or relative investment return thresholds on alternative multi strategy, fixed income and equity hedge funds and separate accounts across regional/country equity strategies, fixed income and multi asset class products. 66 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Revenue (continued) BlackRock Solutions and Advisory. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $17 million, or 4%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in non recurring advisory assignments, as well as the effect of a decline in advisory AUM due to distributions in portfolio liquidation assignments, which have AUM based fees, partially offset by additional Aladdin, risk management solutions and investment accounting mandates. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of advisory and portfolio structuring assignment fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignments. Distribution Fees. Distribution fees of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $16 million from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase primarily reflected higher AUM in certain share classes of BlackRock Funds. Other Revenue. Other revenue of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $111 million from $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other revenue primarily resulted from a $52 million increase in fees, which excludes related portfolio service costs, earned for transition management services due to an increase in transactions to execute transitions of equity and fixed income mandates, a $25 million increase in marketing fees earned from Barclays for services to distribute Barclays iPath&reg; products and $12 million increase for custody fees earned on LifePath products (a portion of which is paid to a third party sub custodian and reflected within direct fund expenses). 67 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Expenses: Employee compensation and benefits $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Distribution and servicing costs 408 477 (69 ) (14 %) Amortization of deferred sales commissions 102 100 2 2 % Direct fund expenses 493 95 398 419 % General and administration 1,354 779 575 74 % Restructuring charges 22 (22 ) (100 %) Amortization of intangible assets 160 147 13 9 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Total expenses, GAAP $ 5,614 $ 3,422 $ 2,192 64 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs Employee compensation and benefits 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) General and administration 65 123 (58 ) (47 %) Total BGI transaction/integration costs 90 183 (93 ) (51 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 % Restructuring charges 22 (22 ) (100 %) Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non GAAP expense adjustments 169 292 (123 ) (42 %) Total expenses, as adjusted $ 5,445 $ 3,130 $ 2,315 74 % Total GAAP expenses increased $2,192 million, or 64%, to $5,614 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,422 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding certain items deemed non recurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not affect the Companys book value, total expenses, as adjusted, increased $2,315 million, or 74%. The increase in total expenses, as adjusted, was primarily attributable to the BGI Transaction including increases in employee compensation and benefits, general and administration expenses and direct fund expenses, partially offset by a reduction of distribution and servicing costs. 68 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) Employee Compensation and Benefits Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change Employee compensation and benefits, GAAP $ 3,097 $ 1,802 $ 1,295 72 % Less non GAAP expense adjustments: BGI transaction/integration costs 25 60 (35 ) (58 %) PNC LTIP funding obligation 58 59 (1 ) (2 %) Merrill Lynch compensation contribution 10 10 % Compensation expense related to appreciation (depreciation) on deferred compensation plans 11 18 (7 ) (39 %) Total non GAAP expense adjustments 104 147 (43 ) (29 %) Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted $ 2,993 $ 1,655 $ 1,338 81 % Employees at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately 9,100 as compared to approximately 8,600 at December 31, 2009. Employee compensation and benefits, as adjusted, increased by $1,338 million excluding the $43 million decrease in non GAAP adjustments primarily related to lower BGI integration costs. The $1,338 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was attributable to a $721 million increase in incentive compensation and a $617 million increase in salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, temporary help and commissions. The increase in incentive compensation is primarily associated with the increase in operating income after excluding the BGI integration costs, a $132 million increase in stock based compensation expense related to the effect of additional grants to a larger number of employees at the end of January 2010. The $617 million increase in salaries, benefits and payroll taxes reflected an increase in the number of employees primarily resulting from the BGI Transaction as well as growth in number of employees subsequent to the BGI Transaction. Distribution and Servicing Costs. Distribution and servicing costs decreased $69 million to $408 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $477 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. These costs include payments to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch under a global distribution agreement, PNC and Barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with the distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. The $69 million decrease primarily related to lower levels of distribution payments due to lower levels of average cash management AUM and a decrease of costs due to an increase in advisory fee waivers for certain cash management funds serviced by Merrill Lynch. Distribution and servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $246 million of costs attributable to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and affiliates, and $10 million of costs attributable to PNC and affiliates compared with $349 million and $19 million of costs, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2009. Distribution and servicing costs related to other third parties, including Barclays, increased $43 million to $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to an expansion of distribution platforms and higher long term AUM. Amortization of Deferred Sales Commissions. Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $2 million to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Direct Fund Expenses. Direct fund expenses increased $398 million primarily related to the addition of legacy BGI funds subject to arrangements under which BlackRock pays certain fund expenses. 69 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses Year endedDecember 31, Variance (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 Amount % Change General and administration expenses(1), GAAP: Marketing and promotional $ 328 $ 85 $ 243 286 % Occupancy and office related 317 182 135 74 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 152 114 38 33 % Professional services 115 162 (47 ) (29 %) Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 141 101 40 40 % Total general and administration expenses, GAAP $ 1,354 $ 779 $ 575 74 % Less BGI transaction and integration costs: Marketing and promotional $ 33 $ 11 $ 22 200 % Occupancy and office related 12 1 11 * Technology 2 7 (5 ) (71 %) Professional services 12 91 (79 ) (87 %) Other general and administration 6 13 (7 ) (54 %) Total BGI transaction and integration costs $ 65 $ 123 $ (58 ) (47 %) General and administration expenses, as adjusted: Marketing and promotional $ 295 $ 74 $ 221 299 % Occupancy and office related 305 181 124 69 % Portfolio services 177 100 77 77 % Technology 150 107 43 40 % Professional services 103 71 32 45 % Communications 49 26 23 88 % Regulatory, filing and license fees 34 5 29 580 % Charitable contributions 26 2 24 * Closed end fund launch costs 15 2 13 650 % Other general and administration 135 88 47 53 % Total general and administration expenses, as adjusted $ 1,289 $ 656 $ 633 96 % * Not applicable.

BGI Transaction and Integration Costs. BGI integration costs of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $58 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to advisory and legal costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by higher re branding costs in 2010. 70 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses (continued) General and Administration Expenses, as Adjusted Marketing and promotional expenses increased $221 million, primarily due to an increase in global and exchange traded fund marketing expenses, which included travel, promotional and rebranding and advertising expenses. Occupancy and office related expenses increased $124 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction, including expenses related to Drapers Gardens and an increase in lease impairments as a result of vacating certain locations in the year ended December 31, 2010. Portfolio service costs increased $77 million, due to an increase in market data and research expenses as well as transition management execution and clearing expenses. Technology expenses increased $43 million primarily due to an increase in software licensing and maintenance and hardware depreciation expenses. Professional services increased $32 million primarily related to consulting, accounting/tax and legal costs. Communications increased $23 million primarily related to the expansion of the Company due to the BGI Transaction. Regulatory, filing and license fees increased $29 million primarily due to a $20 million U.K. regulatory assessment. Charitable contributions increased $24 million, which is primarily related to a contribution to a donor advised charitable fund. Closed end fund launch costs (excluding compensation costs) increased $13 million due to the Build America Bond Trust fund, which launched during the year ended December 31, 2010 and generated approximately $1.2 billion in AUM. Other general and administration expenses increased $47 million due to an increase of $86 million related to growth of the Company including recruiting, training and insurance costs, as well as costs for potential operating errors/fines, partially offset by a $17 million change in foreign currency remeasurement costs/benefits from $11 million of costs in the year ended December 31, 2009 to a $6 million benefit in the year ended December 31, 2010, a $9 million decline in an expense for a potentially uncollectible receivable recorded in 2009 and $9 million of lower provisions related to an outstanding loan to Anthracite Capital Inc. Restructuring Charges. For the year ended December 31, 2009, BlackRock recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $22 million primarily related to severance, outplacement costs, occupancy costs and accelerated amortization of certain previously granted stock awards associated with a reduction in work force and reengineering efforts. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased $13 million to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in amortization of intangible assets reflects amortization of finite lived management contracts acquired in the BGI Transaction. 71 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 Non Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non Controlling Interests Non operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: Year endedDecember 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2010 2009 $ Change Non operating income (expense), GAAP basis $ 23 $ (6 ) $ 29 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI(1) (13 ) 22 (35 ) Non operating income (expense)(2) 36 (28 ) 64 Compensation expense related to (appreciation) depreciation on deferred compensation plans (11 ) (18 ) 7 Non operating income (expense), as adjusted(2) $ 25 $ (46 ) $ 71 (1) Amount includes a $35 million loss attributable to consolidated variable interest entities for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The $36 million non operating income, net of non controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2010 was comprised of $146 million of net gains on co investments and seed investments and $11 million of appreciation related to hedges of deferred compensation, partially offset by $121 million of net interest expense. Net gain on co investments and seed investments increased $144 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the non recurrence of 2009 valuation declines in real estate equity and debt co investments. Net interest expense was $121 million, an increase of $73 million primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the December 2009 issuances of $2.5 billion of long term notes, partially offset by higher dividend income related to an investment required for regulatory purposes. 72 Table of Contents Non operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Income Tax Expense Year endedDecember 31, %Change Year endedDecember 31, %Change 2010 2009 2010 2009 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAP GAAP As adjusted As adjusted Income before income taxes(1) $ 3,034 $ 1,250 143 % $ 3,192 $ 1,524 109 % Income tax expense $ 971 $ 375 159 % $ 1,053 $ 503 109 % Effective tax rate 32.0 % 30.0 % 33.0 % 33.0 % (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests.

The Company succeeded to a $580 million California net operating loss carryforward for fiscal year 2007, 2008 and 2009 in connection with the BGI Transaction, for which it has not recorded a deferred income tax asset because of certain technical matters related to the predecessors unitary tax returns. The Company will continue to assess these matters, which may result in future tax benefits which, based on current factors, could approximate $40 million, if they are resolved favorably. 73 Table of Contents Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 (continued) Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.

(continued) As Adjusted. Exclusive of the items discussed above, net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. as adjusted, totaled $2,139 million or 10.94 per diluted common share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010, which was an increase of $1,118 million or $3.81 per diluted earnings per common share from the year ended December 31, 2009. Net income and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are described in more detail in the Overview to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Balance Sheet Overview As Adjusted Balance Sheet The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) and separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements, consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) and consolidated sponsored investment funds. The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to eliminate gross presentation of certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or non controlling interests and ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders equity (excluding appropriated retained earnings related to consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)) or cash flows. Management reviews its as adjusted balance sheet, a non GAAP financial measure, as an economic presentation of its total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the collateral received under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending securities held by separate account assets) as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. Consolidated VIEs As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock consolidated five VIEs. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company and the Company has no obligation to settle the liabilities of the VIEs. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. 75 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) December 31, 2011 Segregated client assetsgenerating advisory fees inwhich BlackRock has noeconomic interest orliability (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis SeparateAccountAssets/Collateral ConsolidatedVIEs ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds AsAdjusted Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ $ $ 196 $ 3,310 Accounts receivable 1,960 1,960 Investments 1,631 112 1,519 Assets of consolidated variable interest entities 1,693 1,693 Separate account assets and collateral held under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 Other assets(1) 1,169 5 1,164 Sub total 149,748 139,789 1,693 313 7,953 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 30,148 30,148 Total assets $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits $ 1,383 $ $ $ $ 1,383 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 923 923 Borrowings(2) 4,790 4,790 Liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 1,583 1,583 Separate account liabilities and collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements 139,789 139,789 Deferred income tax liabilities 5,323 5,323 Other liabilities(3) 743 37 706 Total liabilities 154,534 139,789 1,583 37 13,125 Equity Total stockholders equity 25,048 72 24,976 Non controlling interests 314 38 276 Total equity 25,362 110 276 24,976 Total liabilities and equity $ 179,896 $ 139,789 $ 1,693 $ 313 $ 38,101 (1) Amount includes due from related parties, deferred sales commissions, property and equipment and other assets.

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities. These changes do not include assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRocks stockholders equity. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $196 million and $65 million of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2011. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 decreased $135 million from December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting lower performance fees receivables at December 31, 2011 partially offset by higher receivables related to securities lending revenue. 77 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Overview (continued) Investments. BlackRock reports its investments on a GAAP basis, which includes investments that are owned by sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, consolidated even though BlackRock may not own the majority of any such funds. As a result, management reviews its investments on an economic basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact BlackRocks book value. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its investments that are owned by the Company, net of non controlling interests, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net non operating gain (loss) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock, Inc. The Company further presents total net economic investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors as the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense and the impact of hedged investments is substantially mitigated by total return swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as generally there is no impact to BlackRocks stockholders equity as the balance fluctuates. Finally, the Companys regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Companys net economic investment exposure.

Total investments, as adjusted, at December 31, 2011 increased $116 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from $457 million of purchases/capital contributions, $9 million of positive market valuations and earnings from equity method investments, and $8 million of net additional carried interest capital allocations, partially offset by $280 million of sales/maturities and $78 million of distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.

In accordance with GAAP, certain equity method investees do not account for both their financial assets and financial liabilities under fair value measures, therefore, the Companys investment in such equity method investees may not represent fair value. (2) Amounts include BlackRocks portion of cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities that are consolidated from non VIE sponsored investment funds. See Note 5, Fair Value Disclosures, for total GAAP investments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2011 decreased $169 million from December 31, 2010, primarily due to $156 million of amortization expense related to finite lived intangibles. Other Assets. Other assets at December 31, 2011 increased $209 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from a $109 million increase in property and equipment due to additional leasehold improvements and equipment, including capital expenditures related to the lease of U.K. office space located at Drapers Gardens, and a $51 million increase in tax receivables. Accrued Compensation and Benefits. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 decreased $137 million from December 31, 2010 primarily related to lower 2011 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $145 million from December 31, 2010, resulting from decreases in current income taxes payable and unit trust payables. Borrowings. Borrowings at December 31, 2011 increased $1,431 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from net proceeds from new issuances of long term borrowings of $1,496 million, partially offset by conversions of the final $67 million of convertible debt. Deferred Income Tax Liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2011 decreased $154 million primarily as a result of revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to a state tax election, enacted U.K., Japan, U.S. state and local legislation. In addition, the decrease included the effects of temporary differences associated with deferred stock compensation and investment income. Other Liabilities. Other liabilities at December 31, 2011 increased $102 million from December 31, 2010 primarily resulting from an accrual for U.K. lease exit costs, increases in deferred carried interest and liabilities of consolidated funds, partially offset by repayments to Barclays to settle certain non interest bearing notes assumed in the BGI Transaction and a payment related to a U.K. regulatory assessment. Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity at December 31, 2011 decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2010, principally resulting from $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion to repurchase Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net income attributable to BlackRock and $497 million of stock based compensation expense. 79 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Funds and VIEs In accordance with GAAP, BlackRock consolidates certain BlackRock sponsored investment funds and CLOs, notwithstanding the fact BlackRock may only have a minority interest, if any, in these funds or CLOs. As a result, BlackRocks consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, as a supplemental non GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment funds and CLOs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRocks management does not advocate that investors consider such non GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for its cash flow presented in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present a reconciliation of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds and consolidated VIEs: Year ended December 31, 2011 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flowsof ConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ $ 3,302 Cash flows from operating activities 2,826 42 136 2,648 Cash flows from investing activities (204 ) 24 (228 ) Cash flows from financing activities (2,485 ) 65 (136 ) (2,414 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2 2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 139 131 8 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,506 $ 196 $ $ 3,310 Year ended December 31, 2010 (Dollar amounts in millions) GAAPBasis Impact onCash Flows ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds Impact onCash FlowsofConsolidatedVIEs Cash FlowsExcludingImpact ofConsolidatedSponsoredInvestmentFunds and VIEs Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 4,708 $ 75 $ 9 $ 4,624 Cash flows from operating activities 2,488 (76 ) (1 ) 2,565 Cash flows from investing activities (627 ) (52 ) (575 ) Cash flows from financing activities (3,170 ) 118 (8 ) (3,280 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (32 ) (32 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,341 ) (10 ) (9 ) (1,322 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 3,367 $ 65 $ $ 3,302 80 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Operating Activities. Sources of BlackRocks operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenues from BlackRock Solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expenses, general and administration expenses, interest and principal on the Companys borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRocks capital stock, capital expenditures and to purchase co investments and seed investments. Cash inflows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Investing Activities. Cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $228 million and primarily included $247 million of purchases of property and equipment and $262 million of purchases of investments, partially offset by $247 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and $34 million of return of capital from equity method investees. Financing Activities. Cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds and VIEs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,414 million, which included $2.8 billion of stock repurchases, including $2.5 billion related to the repurchase of Bank of Americas remaining ownership interest in BlackRock and $239 million for employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $1.0 billion of cash dividend payments and $67 million for convertible debt repayments. Cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by cash inflows related to $1,496 million of net proceeds from long term borrowings and $56 million of other inflows including excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and proceeds from stock option exercises. Capital Resources The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Capital resources at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,506 $ 3,367 $ 139 4 % Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment funds(1) (196 ) (65 ) (131 ) (202 %) Subtotal 3,310 3,302 8 % 2011 credit facility undrawn 3,400 3,400 * 2007 credit facility undrawn(2) 2,266 (2,266 ) (100 %) Total liquidity $ 6,710 $ 5,568 $ 1,142 21 % Required regulatory capital(3) $ 1,196 $ 897 $ 299 33 % * Not applicable. (1) The Company may not be able to access such cash to use in its operating activities. (2) Amount excludes $134 million of undrawn amounts at December 31, 2010 related to Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. The 2007 credit facility was terminated in March 2011. (3) A portion of the required regulatory capital is partially met with cash and cash equivalents. Total liquidity improved by $1,142 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily reflecting the additional borrowing capacity under the 2011 credit facility compared with the 2007 credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Companys net capital requirements increased $299 million due to increases related to certain European and Asia Pacific regulated legal entities. A significant portion of the Companys $1,519 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, may not be readily convertible to cash. 81 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Short term borrowings The following describes the Companys short term borrowing arrangements, which the Company has access to utilize. 2011 Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2011, the Company entered into a five year $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2011 credit facility), which replaced the 2007 facility. The 2011 credit facility permits the Company to request an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2011 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. The 2011 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of approximately 1 to 1 at December 31, 2011. The 2011 credit facility provides back up liquidity, funds ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and funds various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under this facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Barclays has a $255 million participation under the 2011 credit facility. Commercial Paper Program. On October 14, 2009, BlackRock established a commercial paper program (the CP Program) under which the Company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the CP Notes) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion. The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances during 2011 were used to fund a portion of the repurchase of BlackRocks Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. On May 13, 2011, BlackRock increased the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the CP Program from $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion. The CP Program is currently supported by the 2011 credit facility. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. Share Repurchase Approvals. In July 2010, BlackRock announced that its Board of Directors (the Board) approved the repurchase of up to 5,100,000 shares to neutralize the dilutive effects of restricted stock units and options that have been granted to employees that will become dilutive over the next several years. The shares are to be repurchased with management discretion on the timing of the repurchases. The Company repurchased 618,000 shares in open market transactions for approximately $100 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had repurchased approximately 1,514,000 shares and there were 3,586,000 shares still authorized to be repurchased. In February 2012, the Board approved an increase in the availability under the Companys existing share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to 5.0 million shares of BlackRock common stock. Barclays Support of Certain Cash Funds. Barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management products acquired by BlackRock in the BGI Transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements, Barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to $2.2 billion from December 1, 2009 through December 1, 2013 or until certain criteria are met. BlackRock and Barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from Barclays. At December 31, 2011, Barclays remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock concluded that although these funds were variable interest entities, it was not the primary beneficiary of these funds. 82 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents in those jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the United States, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. BTC is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. BTC provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services to institutional investors and other clients. BTC is subject to various regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2011, the Company was required to maintain approximately $1,196 million in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC and entities regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom, and was in compliance with all applicable regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $1,516 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The Companys current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at December 31, 2011: (Dollar amounts in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Contractual obligations and commitments: Short term borrowings: Principal $ 100 $ $ $ $ $ $ 100 Long term borrowings: Principal 500 750 1,000 2,450 4,700 Interest 180 169 161 126 126 353 1,115 Operating leases 120 131 121 110 99 814 1,395 Purchase obligations 101 80 65 22 11 279 Investment commitments 112 112 Total contractual obligations and commitments 1,113 1,130 1,347 258 236 3,617 7,701 Contingent obligations: Contingent distribution obligations 194 194 388 Total contractual obligations, commitments and contingent obligations(1) $ 1,307 $ 1,324 $ 1,347 $ 258 $ 236 $ 3,617 $ 8,089 (1) As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $281 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above. 83 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Short term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $100 million outstanding under the 2011 credit facility with an interest rate of 1.27% and a maturity during January 2012. During January 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.30% and a maturity during February 2012. During February 2012, the Company rolled over the $100 million in borrowings at an interest rate of 1.26% and a maturity during March 2012. Long term Borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the principal amount of long term borrowings was $4.7 billion. Debt service and repayment requirements are $680 million in 2012, $919 million in 2013, $1,161 million in 2014, $126 million in 2015 and 2016. 2017 Notes. In September 2007, the Company issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes maturing on September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes). A portion of the net proceeds of the 2017 Notes was used to fund the initial cash payment for the acquisition of the fund of funds business of Quellos and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. Interest is payable semi annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, or approximately $44 million per year. The 2017 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. 2012, 2014 and 2019 Notes. In December 2009, the Company issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as three separate series of senior debt securities including $0.5 billion of 2.25% notes, $1.0 billion of 3.50% notes and $1.0 billion of 5.0% notes maturing in December 2012, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our CP program, which was used to finance a portion of the BGI Transaction, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes of approximately $96 million per year is payable semi annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. 2013 and 2021 Notes. In May 2011, the Company issued $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured unsubordinated obligations. These notes were issued as two separate series of senior debt securities including $750 million of 4.25% notes and $750 million of floating rate notes maturing in May 2021 and 2013, respectively. Net proceeds of this offering were used to fund the repurchase of BlackRocks Series B Preferred Stock from affiliates of Merrill Lynch. Interest on the 4.25% notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) is payable semi annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011 and is approximately $32 million per year. Interest on the floating rate notes due in 2013 (2013 Floating Rate Notes) is payable quarterly on February 24, May 24, August 24 and November 24 of each year. The 2021 Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at any time in whole or in part at the option of the Company at a make whole redemption price. The 2013 Floating Rate Notes may not be redeemed at the Companys option before maturity. In May 2011, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2013 Floating Rate Notes, the Company entered into a $750 million notional interest rate swap maturing in 2013 to hedge the future cash flows of the obligation at a fixed rate of 1.03% payable semi annually on May 24 and November 24 of each year commencing November 24, 2011. The interest rate swap effectively converts the 2013 Floating Rate Notes to a fixed rate obligation. Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that currently expire through 2035. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease related payments. These leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either non cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2011, the Companys obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office related services and third party marketing and promotional services. Purchase obligations are recorded on the Companys financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services not received are not included in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies (continued) Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $112 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including funds of private equity funds, real estate funds and distressed credit funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third party funds as third party non controlling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment and are, therefore, presented in 2012. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the Companys consolidated statements of financial condition. The above schedule does not include potential future commitments approved by the Companys Capital Committee, but which are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. Carried Interest Claw back. As a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive certain carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Contingent Distribution Obligations. In November 2010, BlackRock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with Merrill Lynch, which requires the Company to make payments to Merrill Lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of AUM maintained in certain BlackRock products. The economic terms of the agreement will remain in effect until January 2014. After such term, the agreement will renew for one automatic three year extension if certain conditions are satisfied. The above schedule reflects the Companys estimated payments for 2012, which due to uncertainty of asset levels and future additional sales, has been held constant for 2013. The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table: Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in Notes 13, Stock Based Compensation, and 14, Employee Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2011 totaled $1,383 million and included incentive compensation of $1,079 million, deferred compensation of $91 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $213 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2012, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years. Separate Account Liabilities. The separate account assets are maintained by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the Companys consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of the clients. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $118.9 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer. As such, these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Indemnifications. In many of the Companys contracts, including the BGI, MLIM and Quellos Transaction agreements, BlackRock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2011. See further discussion in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Acquisitions. In January 2012, BlackRock announced that it has agreed to acquire Toronto based Claymore Investments, Inc. (Claymore), subject to customary closing conditions. Claymore is a wholly owned independent Canadian subsidiary of Guggenheim Funds Services Group, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, LLC. The total consideration estimated to be paid at closing will be approximately $210 million. 85 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K. Consolidation of Sponsored Investment Funds and Securitization Products. Consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products (collectively investment products) is determined pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. The accounting method used by the Company depends upon the influence the Company has over its investee, the investment product. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investment product. For investment products in which BlackRocks voting interest is less than 50%, an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity (VIE) or a voting rights entity. Upon the determination that the investment product is a VIE, further analysis, as discussed below, is performed to determine if BlackRock is the primary beneficiary (PB) of the investment product, which would require consolidation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Pursuant to ASC 810 10, certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock is required to consolidate a VIE when it is deemed to be the PB, which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change. ASU 2010 10, Amendments to Statement 167 for Certain Investment Funds (ASU 2010 10) defers the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), for certain investment funds, including money market funds. The PB of a VIE that meets the conditions of ASU 2010 10 is the enterprise that has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests, including those of related parties) that absorbs the majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. Effective January 1, 2010, the PB of a VIE that does not meet the conditions for deferral in ASU 2010 10 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. If the Company, together with its related parties, is determined to be the PB of a VIE, BlackRock will consolidate the entity. In order to determine whether the Company is the PB of a VIE for entities that meet the conditions of ASU 2010 10, management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios. Assumptions made in such analyses include, but are not limited to, market prices of securities, market interest rates, potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities, gain realization, liquidity or marketability of certain securities, discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes. In the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or CLOs that do not meet the conditions of ASU 2010 10 and sponsored investment funds, which may be considered VIEs. At December 31, 2011, the Company consolidated five VIEs, including four CLOs and one sponsored private equity fund. 86 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (continued) At December 31, 2011, the following balances related to the five VIEs consolidated on the Companys consolidated statement of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) CLOs SponsoredPrivateEquity Fund TotalConsolidatedVIEs Assets of consolidated VIEs: Cash and cash equivalents $ 47 $ 7 $ 54 Bank loans, bonds and other investments 1,608 31 1,639 Liabilities of consolidated VIEs: Borrowings (1,574 ) (1,574 ) Other liabilities (9 ) (9 ) Appropriated retained earnings (72 ) (72 ) Non controlling interests of consolidated VIEs (38 ) (38 ) Total BlackRock net interests in consolidated VIEs $ $ $ As of December 31, 2011, BlackRock was the manager of over 20 CLOs/CDOs and other securitization entities, including the four aforementioned CLOs in which BlackRock, in accordance with ASU 2009 17, was determined to be the PB, which required BlackRock to consolidate these VIEs. BlackRock was deemed to be the PB because it has the power to direct the activities of the CLO that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1,655 million and $1,583 million in assets and liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated CLOs. In addition, the Company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities, as the CLO noteholders, not BlackRock, ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the CLOs assets and liabilities. The changes in the assets and liabilities of these CLOs have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock or its cash flows. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these VIEs. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock was determined to be the PB of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a non substantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its de facto third party relationships with other partners in the fund, which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without BlackRocks consent as the general partner of the fund. At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded $7 million, $31 million and $38 million in cash and cash equivalents, private equity investments and nonredeemable non controlling interests of consolidated VIEs, respectively, on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this VIE. The changes in the assets and liabilities of this VIE have no impact on net income attributable to BlackRock. Excluding outstanding management fee receivables, the Company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this VIE. 87 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Consolidation of Voting Rights Entities. To the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a 50% or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights, BlackRock consolidates the investee. The Company, as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds, generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Pursuant to ASC 810 20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities (ASC 810 20), the Company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other non affiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the investment vehicle, or otherwise to remove BlackRock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or have other substantive participating rights. If the investment vehicle is not a VIE and the presumption of control is not overcome, BlackRock will consolidate the investment vehicle. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities, including products where BlackRock owns 50% of greater of the voting rights of the product, under the consolidation policies described above, the Company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 196 $ 65 Investments: Trading investments 214 60 Other investments 373 337 Other assets 5 3 Other liabilities (37 ) (10 ) Non controlling interests (276 ) (195 ) BlackRocks net interests in consolidated investment funds $ 475 $ 260 The Company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to ASC 810 10. VIEs, including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and CLOs, were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Investments Equity Method Investments. For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where the Company is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRocks advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the funds operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity. 88 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Equity Method Investments (continued) Substantially all of BlackRocks equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRocks share of the investees underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as non operating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRocks core business. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $476 million and $80 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had $583 million and $58 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively. Impairment of Investments. The Companys management periodically assesses its equity method, available for sale, held to maturity and cost investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the Companys carrying value of the investment, an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. When the fair value of an available for sale security is lower than cost, the Company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be other than temporary. In making this determination for equity securities, the Company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the securitys market value is less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the securitys issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. If the impairment is considered other than temporary, a charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. In making this determination for debt securities, the Company considers whether: (1) the Company has the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If the Company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security, but the security has suffered a credit loss, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 89 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Investments (continued) Impairment of Investments (continued) Evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated statements of income. Fair Value Measurements Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The provisions of ASC 820 10 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 Inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds (including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting as these mutual funds are investment companies that have publicly available net asset values (NAVs), which in accordance with GAAP are calculated under fair value measures and the changes are equal to the earnings of such funds), ETFs, and public equities and certain exchange traded derivatives. Level 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers, for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies. As a practical expedient, the Company relies on the NAV (or its equivalent) of certain investments as their fair value. Level 2 assets in this category may include debt securities, bank loans, short term floating rate notes and asset backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, certain equity method limited partnership interests in hedge funds valued based on NAVs where the Company has the ability to redeem at the measurement date or within the near term without redemption restrictions, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as overthe counter derivatives, including interest and inflation rate swaps and foreign exchange currency contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which may include non binding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. Certain investments that are valued using NAVs and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in Level 3. Level 3 assets in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds, funds of private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, bonds and bank loans. 90 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Fair Value Measurements (continued) Hierarchy of Fair Value Inputs (continued) Level 3 inputs include the most currently available information, including capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. BlackRocks $702 million of Level 3 investments or 43% of total GAAP investments at December 31, 2011 primarily included the above mentioned co investments. Many of these investees are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund, which could include BlackRock employees. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing/valuation information, including independent appraisals from third party sources; however, in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable. In these instances fund management may perform model based analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments. Level 3 liabilities in this category include borrowings of CLOs valued based upon non binding single broker quotes. Significance of Inputs. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. Pricing Services and Broker Quotes. A significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from well recognized third party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price. Annually, BlackRock reviews both the valuation methodology, including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes, and operational process with these vendors. In addition, on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors processes. In addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are non binding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input. Significant Transfers Into and Out of Levels 1, 2, and 3. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company reclassified approximately $47 million of net investments out of Level 3 predominantly to Level 2. The majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that the Company values using a NAV (or a capital account) and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term. Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $1,116 million of investments will impact the Companys non operating income (expense), $52 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $442 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $21 million related to carried interest has no impact on non operating income (expense). As of December 31, 2011, changes in fair value of approximately $587 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact BlackRocks net income (loss) attributable to non controlling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRocks net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $475 million. 91 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of the Companys goodwill and intangible assets were as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Goodwill $ 12,792 $ 12,805 Intangible assets Indefinitelived Management contracts 15,188 15,188 Trade names/trademarks 1,403 1,403 License 6 6 Finitelived, net of accumulated amortization Management contracts 755 911 Other 4 4 Total goodwill and intangible assets $ 30,148 $ 30,317 The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open and closed end investment funds as well as collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with the applicable provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2011, ranged from 2 years to 13 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 5.4 years. Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment test performed as of July 31, 2011 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2011 the Companys common stock closed at $178.24, which exceeded its book value per share of approximately $140.07 after excluding appropriated retained earnings. Indefinite lived and finite lived intangibles. The Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate fair values have declined below their respective carrying amounts on a quarterly basis. Triggering events may include significant adverse changes in the Companys business, financial results, legal or regulatory environment, the loss of key personnel, or other events. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which include a review of all significant assumptions, that would be used to value the asset, to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired. The Company performs such assessments of its intangible assets at least annually. In its assessment of management contracts and trade names/trademarks, the Company considers various factors, including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates to determine whether the carrying values of each intangible asset unit of account are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite life classification is still appropriate. 92 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) Indefinite lived and finite lived intangibles (continued) If potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform an impairment test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite lived intangible assets will contribute to the Companys cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite lived intangible asset to a finite lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Companys amortization expense, which was $156 million, $160 million and $147 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite lived versus finite lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite lived intangibles were required. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The application of ASC 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes, the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes, that require significant management judgment. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Companys current estimates. At December 31, 2011, BlackRock had $349 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $226 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In accordance with ASC 740, management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets of $6 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $5,323 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. ASC 740 requires the Company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Companys experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives. 93 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) At December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded a deferred tax asset of $110 million for unrealized investment losses; however, no valuation allowance has been established because the Company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized, hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses, and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. However, changes in circumstance could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Such changes may be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 19, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F 1 of this Form 10 K for further details. The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Companys actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivable of approximately $108 million and current income taxes payable of $102 million at December 31, 2011. Revenue Recognition. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. Such fees are primarily based on pre determined percentages of the market value of AUM or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. Investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers. The Company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the Company. Such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. In certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that BlackRock bears no credit risk to the third party. The Company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with ASC 605 45, Revenue Recognition Principle Agent Considerations (ASC 605 45), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. Retrocessions for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $928 million, $831 million and $611 million, respectively. The Company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income. The Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to brokerage institutions. Such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. The revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or other third party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, securities lending revenue totaled $397 million, $325 million and $36 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee. 94 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition (continued) The Company receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative and or absolute investment return thresholds. Such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, performance fee revenue totaled $371 million, $540 million and $202 million, respectively. In addition, the Company receives carried interest from certain alternative products upon exceeding performance thresholds. BlackRock may be required to return all, or part, of such carried interest depending upon performance of these funds. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such claw back provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. The Company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income. The Company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $33 million and $23 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate recognition of revenue, if any, for these products is unknown. Fees earned for BlackRock Solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) fixed fees, (ii) percentages of various attributes of advisory AUM or value of positions on the Aladdin platform and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. Revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on AUM of the respective portfolio assignment. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenue totaled $510 million, $460 million and $477 million, respectively. Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRocks investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of AUM and since the Company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of claw back is mathematically improbable. 95 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Amendments to Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04), which amends the existing fair value guidance within ASC 820. The amendments include: (1) application of the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise only to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets (that is, it does not apply to financial assets or any liabilities), (2) an exception to fair value measurement principles for financial assets and financial liabilities (and derivatives) with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk, which allows an entity to measure the fair value of the net risk position, when several criteria are met, (3) extension of the prohibition of a blockage factor application to all fair value measurements, (4) a model for the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entitys shareholders equity which is consistent with the guidance of measuring the fair value for liabilities, (5) additional disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, (ii) a description of the valuation processes used by the entity and (iii) a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements, (6) disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed and (7) disclosure of any transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, not just significant transfers. The provisions of ASU 2011 04 are effective for the Company for the interim period beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to materially impact BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. Amendments to Goodwill Impairment Testing. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011 08), which amends the guidance in ASC 350 on testing goodwill for impairment. Under the revised guidance, entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit (i.e., step 1 of the goodwill impairment test). If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than the carrying amount, the two step impairment test would be required. The amendments are effective for the Company for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning after December 15, 2011. The provisions of SU 2011 08, if elected to be adopted, are not expected to materially impact BlackRocks consolidated financial statements. 96 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AUM Market Price Risk. BlackRocks investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2011, the majority of the Companys investment advisory and administration fees was based on average or period end AUM of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees. Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, investments be reviewed by the Companys Capital Committee, which consists of senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval. In the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments. BlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately $43 million. 97 Table of Contents Corporate Investments Portfolio Risks (continued) At December 31, 2011, approximately $587 million of BlackRocks total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by BlackRock in accordance with GAAP and therefore are consolidated even though BlackRock may not own a majority of such funds. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Companys economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows: (Dollar amounts in millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Variance Amount % Change Total investments, GAAP $ 1,631 $ 1,540 $ 91 6 % Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (587 ) (397 ) (190 ) (48 %) Net exposure to consolidated investment funds 475 260 215 83 % Total investments, as adjusted 1,519 1,403 116 8 % Federal Reserve Bank stock (328 ) (325 ) (3 ) (1 %) Carried interest (21 ) (13 ) (8 ) (62 %) Deferred compensation investments (65 ) (76 ) 11 14 % Hedged investments (43 ) (25 ) (18 ) (72 %) Total economic investment exposure $ 1,062 $ 964 $ 98 10 % The economic investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest rate/credit spread risk disclosures below: Equity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Companys net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $596 million of the Companys total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments, hedge funds and fund of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $59.6 million in the carrying value of such investments. Interest Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $466 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $3 million in the carrying value of such investments. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling and euro was $152 million. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $15.2 million decline in the carrying value of such investments. 98 Table of Contents
