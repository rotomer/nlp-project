Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers. We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contracts and long term relationships help us to mitigate those risks in the majority of circumstances. In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products and expanding volume. Over the past two years, we have closed several packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our worldwide beverage can business. While the North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. While we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our European can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion, we have put on hold various projects, including the completion of the construction of the Poland plant and new construction in India, due to the current world wide economic environment. We are proceeding with the recently announced new one line metal beverage can plant in our Brazil joint venture and are adding further can capacity in the existing Brazilian can plant. These Brazilian expansion efforts will be owned by Balls unconsolidated 50 percent owned joint venture, Latapack Ball Embalagens, Ltda., and the expansion is being funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture. As part of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household products customers. As part of this focus, we installed a new aluminum bottle line, as well as a 24 ounce beverage can production line in our Monticello, Indiana, facility, both of which became operational during the third quarter of 2008. Balls consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report. Page 20 of 96 The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. It is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance. We expect that the delay of certain program awards, as well as federal budget considerations under the new administration, will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in 2009, and we are taking steps to adjust our resources accordingly. We recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost, percentage of completion method of accounting. Our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds percent cost type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component, while the remainder are fixed price contracts. We include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance during 2009 compared to 2008. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of BATCs total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial metric we use is economic value added (tax effected operating earnings, as defined by the company, less a charge for net operating assets employed). Our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis. Other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics and production and sales volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog). We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the companys common stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball stock. CONSOLIDATED SALES AND EARNINGS The company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3) metal food and household products packaging, Americas; (4) plastic packaging, Americas; and (5) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes, Balls operations in the PRC with 2008 net sales of $289.6 million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included within the companys European operations). Also, effective January 1, 2007, a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of $52.1 million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation. Page 21 of 96 Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the PRC. This segment accounted for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (41 percent in 2007, including the impact from the $85.6 million legal settlement with Miller discussed below, and 42 percent in 2006). Excluding the effect of the legal settlement, sales were 4 percent lower in 2008 than in 2007, primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in North American sales volumes of approximately 5 percent. The decrease in North American sales volumes was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers, consistent with the industry, and lost beer sales volumes on discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability. This decrease was somewhat offset by sales volume increases in the PRC of 14 percent during 2008. Sales were 10 percent higher in 2007 than in 2006 (7 percent higher including the effect from the legal settlement) with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices, which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 30 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments and 22 percent of total PRC shipments in 2008. We continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions. During the second quarter of 2007, Miller asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary, and on October 4, 2007, the dispute was settled in mediation. Miller received $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax) on settlement of the dispute, and Ball retained all of Millers beverage can and end supply through 2015. Miller received a one time payment of $70.3 million ($42.5 million after tax) in January 2008 (recorded on the December 31, 2007, consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities) with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract, which extends through 2015. On July 1, 2008, Millers business was combined with the U.S. business of Coors Brewing Company, which we also supply, to form MillerCoors, LLC. Segment earnings in 2008 were $243.5 million ($284.1 million excluding business consolidation costs discussed in more detail below) compared to $240.8 million ($326.4 million excluding the legal settlement) in 2007 and $285.8 million in 2006. Excluding the $40.6 million in business consolidation charges in 2008 and $85.6 million settlement in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent, primarily due to raw material inventory gains of $52 million realized in 2007, which did not recur in 2008. Earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower North American sales volumes, which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the PRC. Positive cost impacts from a new end technology project commenced in 2006 and other cost optimization measures partially offset the prior year non recurring inventory gain and the unfavorable net sales volume decreases. The higher segment earnings in 2007, before the legal settlement, compared to 2006 were due to raw material inventory gains in 2007 that exceeded 2006 by approximately $30 million. Also contributing were approximately $9 million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies. These gains were offset by increased repair and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs, a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers. On April 23, 2008, Ball announced that by the end of 2008 it would close a metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Washington, and in 2008 recorded pretax charges of $7.1 million ($4.3 million after tax), including the sale of the plant facility in the fourth quarter. The closure of the Kent facility is expected to result in net fixed costs savings of approximately $10 million in 2009. Also in the second quarter of 2008, a gain of $7.2 million ($4.4 million after tax) was recorded for the recovery of previously expensed pension, employee severance and other benefit closure obligation costs no longer required. This reflects a decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing end making equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been part of our multi year project. On October 30, 2008, Ball announced the closure of two North American metal beverage can plants. A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be closed by the end of the first quarter 2009, with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12 ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge of Page 22 of 96 approximately $40.7 million ($25.2 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 with an additional $5 million ($3 million after tax) expected in 2009. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to be up to $30 million in 2009 and be $7 million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets. Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in Europe. Ball Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 29 percent of total European metal beverage container manufacturing capacity, has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal beverage container business in Europe. This segment accounted for 25 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (22 percent in 2007 and 20 percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 as compared to 2007 were 13 percent higher due largely to approximately 8 percent higher sales volume, consistent with overall market growth; higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 8 percent on the strength of the euro. These positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes, including product mix changes towards smaller containers. Segment sales in 2007 were 26 percent higher than in 2006, due primarily to over 9 percent higher sales volume, higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 9 percent on the strength of the euro. Higher segment volumes in both periods were aided by the growth in Europe of specialty can volumes, including the successful introduction of the Ball sleek can into Italy. The slow return of the metal beverage can to the German market, following the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on, is being offset by stronger demand outside Germany. Segment earnings were $230.9 million in 2008, $228.9 million in 2007 and $252.3 million ($176.8 million excluding a $75.5 million property insurance gain) in 2006. Earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of $55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, which exceeded the negative impact from product mix, as well as approximately $20 million related to a stronger euro. These improvements were partially offset by $36 million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the British pound to the euro and $35.1 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 (for further details see below). Earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, excluding the $75.5 million property insurance gain received in 2006 due to a fire at the companys Hassloch, Germany, metal beverage can plant (further details are provided below), were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of $76 million due to the combined impact of increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, $16 million from cost control programs and $13 million related to a stronger euro. These improvements were partially offset by $26 million of other higher costs and $15.9 million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in 2007. On April 1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany, damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment. The property insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, which were based on replacement cost, were 86.3 million ($109.9 million). A 26.7 million ($33.8 million) fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire. As a result, a pretax gain of 59.6 million ($75.5 million) was recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds. An additional 27.2 million ($35.1 million) and 40 million ($51 million) were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs, as well as 11.3 million ($14.3 million) in 2006 to offset clean up costs. Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. The company acquired U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) on March 27, 2006, and with that acquisition, added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans, paint cans, plastic pails and decorative specialty cans. Effective January 1, 2007, responsibility for the plastic pail product line, with 2007 net sales of $52.1 million, was transferred to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Accordingly, 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer. Page 23 of 96 This segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (16 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 increased 3 percent as compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business, which led to the announced closure of our Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia, facilities in 2007. We estimate our 2008 shipments account for approximately 19 percent and 50 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments, respectively. Segment sales in 2007 increased 4 percent as compared to 2006 due to an approximate 10 percent increase in sales for the inclusion of a full years sales from the acquisition of U.S. Can, partially offset by a 3 percent decline in sales from lost business, as well as customer operating issues in food cans, including a fire in a customers factory, and unfavorable weather conditions in the Midwest. Segment earnings were $69.7 million ($68.1 million excluding a $1.6 million gain from business consolidation activities) in 2008, compared to a loss of $8 million (earnings of $36.2 million excluding business consolidation costs of $44.2 million) in 2007 and earnings of $2.4 million ($37.9 million excluding business consolidation costs of $35.5 million) in 2006. Excluding the business consolidation activities for each period, earnings in 2008 exceeded 2007 by approximately 88 percent primarily related to improved pricing, better manufacturing performance and the settlement of a claim in the amount of almost $7 million offset by the negative impact of 3 percent lower sales volumes in 2008. The 4 percent lower earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, excluding the business consolidation charges, were primarily related to increased steel and coating material costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in 2007 and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of 2006 related to $6.1 million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired U.S. Can finished goods inventory. While pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials, other direct materials and freight and utility costs, we continue to seek price increases in the market place. In October 2007, Ball announced plans to close aerosol manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California, and announced its intent to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in Baltimore, Maryland. A pretax charge of $44.2 million ($26.8 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily related to these closures. Ball incurred additional net pretax charges of $3.5 million primarily related to lease cancellation costs for the closure of the Commerce facility during 2008. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, it was determined, based on market conditions that we would remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can business, which resulted in the reversal of $5.4 million in business consolidation charges previously recorded. We closed the Tallapoosa facility early in the first quarter of 2009 and do not anticipate further charges related to this closure. When completed in 2009, the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of $15 million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than 85 percent from about 70 percent. The cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, a charge of $35.5 million ($28.7 million after tax) was recorded primarily related to the closure of a plant in Burlington, Ontario, for employee termination and pension costs, plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment charges. The Burlington plant was sold during the third quarter of 2008 completing the restructuring plan, except for pension costs, which resulted in an additional $0.3 million in business consolidation charges. As reported in our second quarter Form 10 Q, during the third quarter our aerosol business experienced a tinplate supply issue due to a major suppliers failure to deliver committed metal. While this matter affected a limited, seasonal part of this segments product mix, it caused a supply disruption with some of our customers that resulted in lost sales and profitability for Ball during the year. We have made every effort to fulfill our customers requests and minimize the impact on our customer base. We are now receiving the necessary tinplate to produce products for our customers, and future raw material supply arrangements are scheduled. Plastic Packaging, Americas The plastic packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S. and Canada (through most of the third quarter of 2008), which manufacture PET and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging, as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications. On March 28, 2006, Ball acquired certain North American plastic bottle container Page 24 of 96 assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan), including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada, as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other Alcan facilities. Effective January 1, 2007, the plastic packaging, Americas, segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the U.S. Can acquisition. Accordingly, 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer. Manufacturing operations ceased in Canada during the third quarter of 2008 with the closure of the Brampton, Ontario, plant. This segment accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (10 percent in both 2007 and 2006). Segment sales in 2008 decreased 2 percent, or approximately $17 million, as compared to 2007 due to a decrease of approximately 9 percent in sales volume offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during 2008. The volume loss included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due, in part, to lower convenience store sales by our customers, which were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets (e.g., custom hot fill, alcohol, food and juice drinks). Reduced preform sales also contributed to the 2008 sales decrease due, in part, to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer. Segment sales in 2007 increased 8 percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in sales of 7 percent related to the March 2006 acquisition of Alcan and the inclusion of the acquired U.S. Can plastic pail business, as well as an increase of 3 percent for higher sales volumes related to the legacy business. Segment earnings were $7.5 million in 2008, $25.9 million in 2007 and $28.3 million in 2006. Excluding the business consolidation charges of $8.3 million in 2008 (further details are provided below) and $0.4 million in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a $1.8 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of 2008. Earnings in 2007 were lower than in 2006 primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately $5 million of customer pricing concessions and $2 million of higher labor and overhead costs. The earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately $2 million from volume growth in specialty PET sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of 2007 related to the acquired Alcan and U.S. Can plants. In view of the low PET margins, we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives, as well as PET development efforts in the custom hot fill, beer, wine, flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets. In the polypropylene plastic container arena, development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets. We estimate our 2008 shipments of PET plastic bottles to be approximately 10 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments. In addition the plastic packaging, Americas, segment shipped approximately 750 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008. On June 26, 2008, Ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in Brampton, Ontario, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008. A pretax charge of $8.3 million ($7.8 million after tax) was recorded during 2008 for employee termination and other benefit costs, lease cancellation costs and fixed asset impairment. The Brampton operations have been consolidated into the companys other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual, fixed cost savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2009. Aerospace and Technologies Aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (11 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion, program terminations, delays in program awards and government funding constraints. The reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts. Segment sales in 2007 were 17 percent higher than in 2006 due to new programs, cost overruns on fixed price contracts, increased scope on previously awarded contracts and growth in our commercial contracts. Some of the segments high profile contracts include: the WorldView 2 advanced commercial remote sensing satellites; the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space Based Space Surveillance System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris; NPOESS, the next generation satellite weather monitoring system; and a number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter. Page 25 of 96 Segment earnings in 2008 were $83.3 million ($76.2 million excluding the sale of an Australian subsidiary discussed in more detail below), $64.6 million in 2007 and $50 million in 2006. Excluding the pretax gain on the sale of BSG of $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2008, earnings in 2008 were up 18 percent in comparison to 2007. Earnings improved year over year as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution, risk retirement on several fixed price programs, as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses. Earnings improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net sales, particularly related to the WorldView and other commercial space contracts, an improved contract mix and better program execution. On February 15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5 million, including cash sold of $1.8 million. BSG provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million. Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 91 percent of segment sales in 2008, 84 percent in 2007 and 90 percent in 2006. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $597 million and $774 million, respectively. Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding the companys segments, see the summary of business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note 6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Undistributed Corporate Expenses, Net Undistributed corporate expenses, net, were $39.6 million, $38.3 million and $37.5 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the undistributed corporate expenses for 2008 was $11.5 million for mark to market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that will reverse and result in a gain in 2009. These aluminum derivative instruments are fully matched with customer sales arrangements that mature in 2009; therefore, the mark to market losses will reverse in 2009 resulting in $11.5 million of pretax earnings. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $288.2 million, $323.7 million and $287.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decreases in SG&A expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to $7.6 million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in February 2008 of the aerospace and technologies segments Australian subsidiary, lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of $3.7 million, life insurance death benefits of $6.5 million, settlement of a claim for approximately $7 million, the favorable net year over year change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of $11.6 million and other miscellaneous net cost reductions. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2007 compared to 2006 were $4.5 million of additional SG&A from the U.S. Can acquisition, higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of $9.4 million, increased sales and marketing efforts of $5.4 million and $15.8 million of compensation and benefit increases, including year over year incentive compensation costs. For the U.S. pension plans, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of 8.25 percent and our discount rate assumption of 6.25 percent for 2009. Based on these assumptions and excluding 2008 curtailment expense, U.S. pension expense for 2009 is anticipated to increase $3.9 million compared to 2008, most of which will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined is expected to be comparable to the 2008 expense. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage Page 26 of 96 point would result in an approximate $2.4 million increase in the 2009 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2.8 million of additional pension expense in 2009. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $137.7 million in 2008, $149.4 million in 2007 and $134.4 million in 2006. The reduced expense in 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, as U.S. and European Central Banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis. The higher expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of U.S. Can and the Alcan assets, combined with higher interest rates in 2007. Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 32.6 percent compared to 26.3 percent in 2007 and 29.4 percent in 2006. The lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of earnings mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit adjustments of $17.2 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006 contributed to higher rates in those years. The 2008 rate was partially reduced by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an enacted tax law change in the United Kingdom, which was offset by the impact of non deductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company owned life insurance plans. The $17.2 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom and a tax loss related to the companys Canadian operations, which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a company owned life insurance plan (discussed below). Based on current estimates, the 2009 effective income tax rate is expected to be around 33.5 percent. During 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the IRS on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company owned life insurance plan. An additional accrual of $7 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of $18.4 million, including interest, for the years 2000 2004, which were under examination, and for the unaudited years 2005 2006. This settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans, which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share, cash flow or liquidity in future periods. Further details are available in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Results of Equity Affiliates Equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the U.S. and Brazil. Earnings were $14.5 million in 2008, $12.9 million in 2007 and $14.7 million in 2006. CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. We had in excess of half a billion dollars of available funds under committed multi currency revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, the current global credit, financial and economic crisis or any of the other factors we describe in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Page 27 of 96 In our worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report to manage future aluminum price volatility for our customers. As these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings. Balls financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark to market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and other financial counterparties on these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. The cash flows of the collateral postings are shown in the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. Assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged, we would expect to recover all of these cash deposits in 2009. Cash flows provided by operations were $627.6 million in 2008 compared to $673 million in 2007 and $401.4 million in 2006. The reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately $70 million in January 2008 of a legal settlement to a customer. This reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation, lower tax payments, lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year. The improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in 2007 and the insurance gain in 2006 related to the Hassloch fire. The improvement in 2007 was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher pension contributions. Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to plan stock buy back levels, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of such an item included the companys decision in 2007 to contribute an additional $44.5 million ($27.3 million after tax) to its pension plans. Additional examples include property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our Hassloch, Germany, plant, which are included in capital spending amounts in 2006. Based on this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash flows from operating activities $ 627.6 $ 673.0 $ 401.4 Capital spending (306.9 ) (308.5 ) (279.6 ) Proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets 48.6 61.3 Incremental pension funding, net of tax 27.3 Free cash flow $ 320.7 $ 440.4 $ 183.1 Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2009 to be approximately $625 million, capital spending to be approximately $250 million and free cash flow to be in the $375 million range. Capital spending of $306.9 million in 2008 exceeded depreciation and amortization expense of $297.4 million. We have reduced our expected capital spending year over year, and we do not intend to buy back stock until the capital markets show sufficient signs of recovery. Initially in 2009 we will focus on reducing our debt and growing our cash balances. Debt Facilities and Refinancing Interest bearing debt at December 31, 2008, increased $51.5 million to $2.41 billion from $2.36 billion at December 31, 2007. The 2008 debt increase from 2007 was primarily due to the financing of $105.5 million in net cash collateral deposits. In 2009 we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while covering our capital spending programs, dividends and incremental pension funding. At December 31, 2008, $502 million was available under the companys multi currency revolving credit facilities. The company also had $332 million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year, of which $155.6 million was outstanding. The committed credit facilities are available until October 2011. Page 28 of 96 Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until October 2011, the companys liquidity is strong and is expected to meet its ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the current financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties, thus limiting exposure with any one party. The company also monitors the credit ratings of its suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis. The current financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers. In October 2008, we advanced interest bearing funding of $22 million in support of one of our key suppliers, which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory. The company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North American packaging operations up to $250 million. The agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, as amended by SFAS No. 156. Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled $250 million and $170 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The company was in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2008, and all prior years presented, and has met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about the companys debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Notes 15 and 9, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Other Liquidity Items Cash payments required for long term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2008, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due By Period (a) ($ in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 Years Long term debt $ 2,250.7 $ 147.3 $ 1,140.5 $ 509.3 $ 453.6 Capital lease obligations 3.8 0.5 0.8 0.8 1.7 Interest payments on long term debt (b) 485.2 98.7 166.4 93.3 126.8 Operating leases 187.3 46.7 66.0 36.7 37.9 Purchase obligations (c) 3,818.9 2,004.9 1,632.3 181.7 Total payments on contractual obligations $ 6,745.9 $ 2,298.1 $ 3,006.0 $ 821.8 $ 620.0 (a) Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end exchange rates. (b) For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments. (c) The companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly. Page 29 of 96 Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, may be in the range of $88 million to $93 million in 2009. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $69.5 million, $73.7 million, $76.4 million, $81 million and $84.5 million for the years ending December 31, 2009 through 2013, respectively, and a total of $482.7 million for the years 2014 through 2018. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $24 million to $25 million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of $125.6 million for the years 2014 through 2018. Our share repurchases in 2008 aggregated $299.6 million, net of issuances, compared to $211.3 million net of repurchases in 2007 and $45.7 million in 2006. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases included a $51.9 million settlement on January 5, 2007, of a forward contract entered into in December 2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000 shares. We do not expect to repurchase a significant number of common shares in 2009. On December 12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $100 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $100 million on January 7, 2008, and received 2,038,657 shares, which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521 shares. Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Total dividends paid were $37.5 million in 2008, $40.6 million in 2007 and $41 million in 2006. Contingencies The company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which the company participates. We do business in countries outside the U.S., have changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our packaging products and participate in changing capital markets. We attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including, at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments as explained in Item 7A of this report. From time to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Pursuant to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of U.S. Can, a certain portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of U.S. Can was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash, which was to be used for the settlement of certain post acquisition claims, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, Ball asserted claims against the former shareholders of U.S. Can, which were disputed. The representative for the former shareholders of U.S. Can filed a lawsuit against the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company. This matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008. Our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect these estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report for a summary of the companys critical and significant accounting policies. Management believes that evaluation of Balls performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements. Page 30 of 96 Forward Looking Statements The company has made or implied certain forward looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the current global credit crisis and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal and plastic container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures such as our beverage can end project; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the recent significant increases in resin, steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; regulatory action or federal and state legislation including mandated corporate governance and financial reporting laws; the effects of the German mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging legislation such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; boycotts; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; accounting changes; local economic conditions; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; the current global credit situation; international business and market risks such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies and the activities of foreign subsidiaries; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates and activities of foreign subsidiaries) in Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Argentine peso, and in the foreign exchange rate of the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar and Indian rupee; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process, particularly the recent publicity concerning Bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company); technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal controls over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Page 31 of 96 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below. Commodity Price Risk We manage our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing. Most of the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2008 and in 2007, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next 12 months. In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes. Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the companys steel, aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated $6 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent, we estimate there could be an $8 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices, without considering such pass through provisions, could result in an estimated $7 million after tax reduction of net earnings Page 32 of 96 over a one year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $2 million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Subsequent to year end, the company has taken further steps to reduce its exposure to natural gas and diesel fuel prices in 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2008, included pay fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars. Pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate. Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $7 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars. Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $18 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. This amount includes the $8 million currency exposure discussed above in the Commodity Price Risk section. This hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $84 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Common Share Repurchases As part of the companys ongoing share repurchase program and as a way to partially reduce the earnings volatility of the companys variable deferred compensation stock program, from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock. The company currently has 500,000 shares of equity put options outstanding at a strike price of $40 per share that expire in less than 12 months. On December 3, 2007, Ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of 675,000 shares of its common stock. This agreement was settled for $31 million on January 7, 2008, and the shares were delivered that day. On December 12, 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately $100 million. The agreement provided for the delivery of 2,038,657 shares, which represented 90 percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered. The $100 million was paid on January 7, 2008, at the time the shares were delivered. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521 shares.
