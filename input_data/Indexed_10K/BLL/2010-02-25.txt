Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this report, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Business Overview Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers. We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contracts and long term relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss. We are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other inputs into our direct costs. We reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products and expanding volumes. Over the past two years, we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations. As part of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household products customers. While the North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. While we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our European can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion, we have put on hold various projects, including the completion of the construction of a plant in Poland, due to the current world wide economic environment. However, we continue to believe that Central and Eastern Europe will be an area of growth once the economy recovers. Our Brazilian joint venture has completed the construction of a metal beverage container plant near Rio de Janeiro and has added further can capacity in the existing Jacarei can plant. These Brazilian expansion efforts are owned by Balls unconsolidated 50 percent owned joint venture, Latapack Ball Embalagens, Ltda., and the expansion was funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture. Page 19 of 97 Balls consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. It is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance. We expect that the delay of certain program awards, as well as federal budget considerations, will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in 2010, and we are continuing to take steps to adjust our resources accordingly. We recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost, percentage of completion method of accounting. Our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds cost type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component, and approximately 20 percent fixed price contracts. The remainder represents time and material contracts, which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance in 2010 compared to 2009. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp.s total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. Management Performance Measures Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities; free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment); and economic value added (net operating earnings after tax, as defined by the company, less a capital charge on net operating assets employed). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on dispositions. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog). We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of Ball and, because of that, we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the companys common stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various long term and stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball stock. Page 20 of 97 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Sales and Earnings The company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3) metal food and household products packaging, Americas; (4) plastic packaging, Americas; and (5) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,888.8 $ 2,989.5 $ 3,098.1 Legal settlement (a) (85.6 ) Total net sales $ 2,888.8 $ 2,989.5 $ 3,012.5 Segment earnings $ 296.0 $ 284.1 $ 326.4 Legal settlement (a) (85.6 ) Business consolidation costs (a) (6.8 ) (40.6 ) Total segment earnings $ 289.2 $ 243.5 $ 240.8 (a) Further details of these items are included in Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the PRC. This segment accounted for 39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 (40 percent in 2008 and 41 percent in 2007, including the impact of the $85.6 million legal settlement discussed below). Net sales were 3 percent lower in 2009 than in 2008, primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by a 2 percent increase in sales volumes. The higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from Anheuser Busch InBev n.v./s.a. (AB InBev) on October 1 (discussed further below), partially offset by lower sales volumes and plant closures in the existing business. Excluding the effect of the legal settlement, sales were 4 percent lower in 2008 than in 2007, primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in North American sales volumes of approximately 5 percent. The decrease was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers, consistent with the industry, and lost beer sales volumes on the discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability. This decrease was partially offset by sales volume increases in the PRC of 14 percent during 2008. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers in 2009 were approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments and 22 percent of total PRC shipments. We continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions. In 2007 a customer asserted various claims against the company, primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by a subsidiary, and on October 4, 2007, the dispute was settled in mediation. The customer received $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax) to settle the dispute, and Ball retained all of the customers beverage can and end supply through 2015. Ball made a one time payment of $70.3 million ($42.5 million after tax) in January 2008 with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract. Excluding the business consolidation charges, segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to $12 million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants, approximately $21 million of savings associated with the plant closures discussed below and $3 million of margin growth in Asia. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes (excluding the newly acquired plants) and $25 million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009. Excluding the business consolidation charge in 2008 and the legal settlement in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent, primarily due to raw material inventory gains of $52 million realized in 2007, which did not recur in 2008. Earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower North American sales volumes, which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the PRC. Page 21 of 97 On October 1, 2009, the company acquired three of Anheuser Busch InBev n.v./s.a.s (AB InBev) metal beverage can manufacturing plants and one of its beverage can end manufacturing plants, all of which are located in the U.S., for $574.7 million in cash. The acquired plants produce approximately 10 billion aluminum beverage containers and 10 billion beverage can ends annually, more than two thirds of which are produced for leading soft drink companies and the rest for AB InBev. The plants operations were included in Balls results beginning October 1, 2009, which amounted to $160 million of net sales and $12 million of segment earnings from that date through December 31, 2009. The facilities acquired employ approximately 635 people. The acquired plants will enhance the segments ability to better serve its customers. On November 9, 2009, the company announced its agreement to acquire Guangdong Jianlibao Group Co., Ltds (Jianlibao) 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui, PRC. Ball has owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992. Ball will acquire the plant and related net assets for approximately $90 million in cash and assumed debt and will also enter into a long term supply agreement with Jianlibao. The transaction is expected to close in 2010, subject to customary regulatory approvals. We are actively pursuing improved profitability through better asset utilization and cost optimization throughout the segment. We are also committed to improving margins on this portion of our business through better commercial terms. We continue to focus efforts on the custom beverage can business, specifically on cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes and by developing cans with added functional attributes (such as resealability) and through product line extensions. As part of our efforts to improve profitability, we undertook various actions in 2009 and 2008 including the reduction of headcount in our metal beverage packaging business and the closures of our Guayama, Puerto Rico; Kansas City, Missouri; and Kent, Washington, metal beverage container plants. Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 1,739.5 $ 1,868.7 $ 1,653.6 Segment earnings 214.8 230.9 228.9 The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in Europe. Ball Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 32 percent of total European metal beverage container shipments in 2009 (excluding Russia), has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal beverage container business in Europe. This segment accounted for 24 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 (25 percent in 2008 and 22 percent in 2007). Segment sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 were 7 percent lower due to the translation impact of the euro to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by better commercial terms. Sales volumes in 2009 were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year. Segment sales in 2008 were 13 percent higher than in 2007, due largely to higher sales volumes of approximately 8 percent, consistent with overall market growth, higher sales prices and foreign currency gains of 8 percent on the strength of the euro. These positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes, including product mix changes towards smaller containers. While 2009 sales volumes were consistent with the prior year, the adverse effects of foreign currency translation, both within Europe and on the conversion of the euro to the U.S. dollar, reduced segment earnings by $8 million. Also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into 2009 and a change in sales mix, partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts. Earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of approximately $55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, which exceeded the negative impact from product mix, as well as approximately $20 million related to a stronger euro. These improvements were partially offset by approximately $36 million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the British pound to the euro and $35 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 (for further details see below). Page 22 of 97 In April 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany, damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment. In 2007 the company recorded 37.6 million ($48.6 million) for insurance proceeds, which were based on replacement cost, and 27.2 million ($35.1 million) in cost of sales for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs. Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 1,392.9 $ 1,221.4 $ 1,183.4 Segment earnings $ 130.8 $ 68.1 $ 36.2 Business consolidation costs (a) (2.6 ) 1.6 (44.2 ) Total segment earnings $ 128.2 $ 69.7 $ (8.0 ) (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina and includes the manufacture and sale of metal food cans, aerosol cans, paint cans, general line cans and decorative specialty cans. Segment sales were 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 (16 percent in both 2008 and 2007). Segment sales in 2009 increased 14 percent over 2008 due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in 2009, which were partially offset by an 11 percent decrease in sales volume caused by the effects of the economic recession and Balls decision to not pursue low margin business. We estimate our 2009 shipments accounted for approximately 18 percent and 45 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments, respectively. Segment sales in 2008 increased 3 percent compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business, which led to the announced closure of our Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia, facilities in 2007. Excluding the business consolidation activities for each period, earnings in 2009 were 92 percent higher than in 2008 due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with $44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 and $22 million of improvements in manufacturing performance, partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of $7 million in 2008 not recurring in 2009. The 88 percent higher earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 were largely related to improved pricing, better manufacturing performance and the $7 million settlement gain, partially offset by the negative impact of 3 percent lower sales volumes in 2008. As part of our efforts to improve profitability in this segment and to better align supply with customer demand, we announced plans in October 2007 to close aerosol manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California. The Commerce plant was closed in 2008, and the Tallapoosa plant was closed in the first quarter of 2009. The cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries. Plastic Packaging, Americas ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 634.9 $ 735.4 $ 752.4 Segment earnings $ 16.3 $ 15.8 $ 26.3 Business consolidation costs (a) (23.8 ) (8.3 ) (0.4 ) Gain on disposition (a) 4.3 Total segment earnings $ (3.2 ) $ 7.5 $ 25.9 (a) Further details of these items are included in Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Page 23 of 97 The plastic packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S. (and Canada through most of the third quarter of 2008), which manufacture PET and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging, as well as polypropylene containers for household product applications. On October 23, 2009, the company announced the sale of its plastic pail assets to BWAY Corporation for approximately $32 million. The transaction involved the sale of a plastic pail manufacturing plant in Newnan, Georgia, which Ball acquired in 2006 as part of its purchase of U.S. Can Corporation, and associated contracts. The plant produces injection molded plastic pails and drums for products such as building materials and pool chemicals. The associated after tax loss was insignificant. This segment accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 (9 percent in 2008 and 10 percent in 2007). Segment sales in 2009 were down 14 percent from sales in 2008 despite an increase in conversion sales prices. An 11 percent decline in bottle sales volumes and a 15 percent reduction in preform sales volumes were the primary reasons for lower sales compared to 2008. Other factors contributing to lower 2009 sales included resin price reductions and the previously mentioned disposition of the plastic pail assets. Segment sales in 2008 decreased 2 percent compared to 2007 due to a decrease of approximately 9 percent in sales volumes offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during 2008. The volume losses over the three year period included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due, in part, to lower convenience store sales by our customers. The volume losses were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets, which include custom hot fill, alcohol, food and juice drinks. Reduced preform sales also contributed to the sales decreases over the three years due, in part, to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding business consolidation charges and the pretax gain on sale of the plastic pail assets, segment earnings in 2009 were slightly higher than in 2008, primarily due to higher selling prices and improved operating performance, including benefits from a plant closure in the third quarter of 2008 and plant closures in the third quarter of 2009, offset by lower sales volumes. Segment earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a $1.8 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of 2008. In view of the low PET margins, we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives, as well as PET development efforts in the custom hot fill, beer, wine, flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets. In the polypropylene plastic container arena, development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets. We estimate our 2009 shipments of PET plastic bottles to be approximately 8 percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments. In addition, the plastic packaging, Americas, segment shipped approximately 625 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2009. To improve cost performance and gain efficiencies, in the third quarter of 2009 we closed PET plastic packaging manufacturing plants in Watertown, Wisconsin, and Baldwinsville, New York. A plastic packaging manufacturing plant in Brampton, Ontario, was closed in the third quarter of 2008. Aerospace and Technologies ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 689.2 $ 746.5 $ 787.8 Segment earnings $ 61.4 $ 76.2 $ 64.6 Gain on disposition (a) 7.1 Total segment earnings $ 61.4 $ 83.3 $ 64.6 (a) Further details of this item are included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 (10 percent in 2008 and 11 percent in 2007). Segment sales in 2009 were 8 percent lower than in 2008, driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft. Segment sales in 2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion, program terminations, delays in program awards and government funding constraints. The reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts. Page 24 of 97 Some of the segments high profile contracts include: the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space Based Space Surveillance System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris; NPOESS, the next generation satellite weather monitoring system; and a number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter. During 2009, we shipped several large instruments/spacecraft including Kepler (January ship, March launch), WorldView 2 (August ship, October launch), WISE (August ship, December launch) and participated in the latest Hubble servicing mission in May. This segment is also supporting the replacement of the current space shuttle program. Excluding the gain on the sale of an Australian subsidiary (BSG) in 2008, earnings in 2009 were down 19 percent compared to 2008, primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity. Excluding the sale of BSG, segment earnings in 2008 were up 18 percent in comparison to 2007. Earnings improved in 2008 as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution, risk retirement on several fixed price programs, as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses. On February 15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5 million, including cash sold of $1.8 million. The subsidiary provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million. Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 94 percent of segment sales in 2009, 91 percent in 2008 and 84 percent in 2007. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $518 million and $597 million, respectively. Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding the companys segments, see the summary of business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note 6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Undistributed Corporate Expenses, Net Included in undistributed corporate expenses for 2009 was a $34.8 million gain ($30.7 million after tax) on the sale of a portion of our investment in DigitalGlobe, a provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services, in conjunction with DigitalGlobes initial public offering. The sale generated proceeds of $37.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. Also included in 2009 was a charge of $11.1 million ($6.7 million after tax) for transaction costs associated with the AB InBev acquisition, which, in accordance with recent changes to the guidance related to accounting for business combinations, are required to be expensed as incurred. The transaction costs are included in the business consolidation and other activities line of the consolidated statement of earnings. Undistributed corporate expenses in 2008 included $11.5 million for mark to market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that were largely recovered in 2009 through customer contract arrangements. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $328.6 million, $288.2 million and $323.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases in SG&A expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of approximately $31 million of higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation costs, and higher stock based compensation costs, including mark to market adjustments for the companys deferred compensation stock plans; $13 million of gains in 2008 not recurring in 2009, including a $7 million claim settlement and $7 million of death benefit insurance proceeds; and $8 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts. These were offset by net favorable decreased costs of $12 million, including lower receivables securitization fees, legal expenses and research and development costs. The decreases in SG&A expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to approximately $8 million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in February 2008 of BSG, lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of $4 million, life insurance death benefits of $7 million, the settlement of a claim for $7 million, the favorable net year over year change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of $13 million, and other miscellaneous net cost reductions. Page 25 of 97 Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $117.2 million in 2009, $137.7 million in 2008 and $149.4 million in 2007. The lower expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of $700 million of new senior notes in August 2009. The reduced expense in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, as U.S. and European Central Banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis. Based on current estimates, the 2010 effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 33 percent. Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 was 30.3 percent compared to 32.6 percent in 2008 and 26.3 percent in 2007. The lower tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a $4 million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement, legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward; a $6 million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investment and other assets due to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of $11 million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions. These benefits were offset somewhat by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions, lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes. The lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 was primarily the result of earnings mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit adjustments of $17 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 contributed to a higher effective tax rate. The 2008 rate was partially reduced by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an enacted tax law change in the United Kingdom, which was offset by the impact of nondeductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company owned life insurance plans. The $17 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom and a tax loss related to the companys Canadian operations, which were offset by an increase in the tax provision for uncertain tax positions in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a company owned life insurance plan (discussed below). During 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the IRS on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company owned life insurance plan. An additional accrual of $7.0 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of $18.4 million, including interest, for the years 2000 through 2006. This settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans, which has not had a significant impact on earnings per share, cash flow or liquidity. Further details are available in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Results of Equity Affiliates Equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the U.S. and Brazil. Earnings were $13.8 million in 2009, $14.5 million in 2008 and $12.9 million in 2007. CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. We had in excess of $600 million of available funds under committed multi currency revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2009. Page 26 of 97 Cash flows provided by operations were $559.7 million in 2009 compared to $627.6 million in 2008 and $673 million in 2007. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year. The reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately $70 million in January 2008 of a legal settlement to a customer. This reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation, lower tax payments, lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year. Financial Instrument Collateral In our worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report to manage certain future aluminum price volatility for our customers. As these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings. Our agreements with our financial counterparties require us to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark to market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers on these derivative contracts. The cash flows of the collateral postings are shown within the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. At December 31, 2009, Ball had $14.2 million of cash posted as collateral, which was offset by cash collateral receipts from customers of $14.2 million. At December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124.0 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. Management Performance Measures The following financial measurements are on a non U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Non U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this report. Free Cash Flow Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to plan stock buyback levels, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. In 2007 we adjusted free cash flow to reflect our decision to contribute an additional $44.5 million ($27.3 million after tax) to our pension plans and to include the property insurance proceeds used to fund the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our Hassloch, Germany, plant. Based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows from operating activities $ 559.7 $ 627.6 $ 673.0 Capital spending (187.1 ) (306.9 ) (308.5 ) Proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets 48.6 Incremental pension funding, net of tax 27.3 Free cash flow $ 372.6 $ 320.7 $ 440.4 There were no reconciling items to cash flows from investing or financing activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows within Item 8 of this report. Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2010 to be approximately $735 million, capital spending to be approximately $235 million and free cash flow to be in the $500 million range. These estimates do not reflect that, under new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2010, our accounts receivable securitization program will likely be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the related activity shown in our consolidated cash flow statement as a financing activity rather than as an operating activity. In 2010 we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while increasing our stock repurchases and covering our capital spending programs. Page 27 of 97 EBIT and EBITDA Management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT) and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) to evaluate the companys performance. EBIT and EBITDA are typically derived directly from the companys consolidated statement of earnings; however, they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Management also uses interest coverage and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios as metrics to monitor our credit quality. Based on the above definitions, our calculation of adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, interest coverage ratio and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio are summarized below: ($ in millions, except ratios) 2009 2008 2007 Net earnings $ 388.4 $ 319.9 $ 281.7 Add interest expense 117.2 137.7 149.4 Add tax provision 162.8 147.4 95.7 Less equity in results of affiliates (13.8 ) (14.5 ) (12.9 ) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 654.6 590.5 513.9 Add business consolidation and other activities 44.5 52.1 44.6 Less gain on dispositions (39.1 ) (7.1 ) Add legal settlement 85.6 Adjusted EBIT 660.0 635.5 644.1 Add depreciation and amortization 285.2 297.4 281.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 945.2 $ 932.9 $ 925.1 Interest expense $ 117.2 $ 137.7 $ 149.4 Total debt at December 31 $ 2,596.2 $ 2,410.1 $ 2,358.6 Less cash (210.6 ) (127.4 ) (151.6 ) Net Debt $ 2,385.6 $ 2,282.7 $ 2,207.0 Adjusted EBIT/Interest coverage 5.6 x 4.6 x 4.3 x Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.4 x Debt Facilities and Refinancing Interest bearing debt at December 31, 2009, increased $186.1 million to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion at December 31, 2008. The relatively small debt increase from 2008 was achieved despite our issuance of $700 million of new senior notes on August 20, 2009. At December 31, 2009, $663 million was available under our multi currency revolving credit facilities. These committed credit facilities are available until October 2011. We also had $305 million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year, on which $63.5 million was outstanding. Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until October 2011, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis. The financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers. In October 2008, we advanced interest bearing funding of $22 million in support of one of our key suppliers, which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory. At December 31, 2009, the amount advanced was included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet included within Item 8 of this report. Page 28 of 97 We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2009, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Notes 15 and 8, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Accounts Receivable Securitization We have a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North American packaging operations up to $250 million. The agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under accounting guidance in effect through December 31, 2009. Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled $250 million at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Under new accounting guidance that will be effective as of January 1, 2010, it is likely that the sold accounts receivable will remain on our consolidated balance sheet, resulting in a corresponding increase in debt. This will create a one time reduction in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 and an offsetting one time increase in cash flows from financing activities. Other Liquidity Items Cash payments required for long term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2009, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due By Period (a) ($ in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt $ 2,547.3 $ 248.8 $ 1,142.4 $ 0.6 $ 1,155.5 Interest payments on long term debt (b) 771.3 125.3 232.9 161.1 252.0 Operating leases 152.4 43.1 56.6 30.2 22.5 Purchase obligations (c) 4,198.1 1,969.8 1,943.2 262.1 23.0 Total payments on contractual obligations $ 7,669.1 $ 2,387.0 $ 3,375.1 $ 454.0 $ 1,453.0 (a) Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end 2009 exchange rates. (b) For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments. (c) The companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly. Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be in the range of $55 million in 2010. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $78 million, $80 million, $83 million, $87 million and $91 million for the years ending December 31, 2010 through 2014, respectively, and a total of $520 million for the years 2015 through 2019. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $24 million to $25 million in each of the years 2010 through 2014 and a total of $113 million for the years 2015 through 2019. For the U.S. pension plans in 2010, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of 8.25 percent and to change our discount rate assumption to 6.00 percent (from 6.25 percent in 2009). Based on these assumptions, U.S. pension expense for 2010 is anticipated to increase approximately $5 million compared to 2009 expense of $48.1 million, most of which will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined is expected to be higher than the 2009 expense of $25.8 million by approximately $2 million. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $2.7 million increase in the 2010 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $3.2 million of additional pension expense in 2010. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Page 29 of 97 Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Total dividends paid were $37.4 million in 2009, $37.5 million in 2008 and $40.6 million in 2007. Share Repurchases Our share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $5.1 million in 2009, $299.6 million in 2008 and $211.3 million in 2007. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases included a $51.9 million settlement on January 5, 2007, of a forward contract entered into in December 2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000 shares. On December 12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $100 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. We advanced the $100 million on January 7, 2008, and received 2,038,657 shares, which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521 shares. Subsequent Event On February 17, 2010, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $125 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $125 million on February 22, 2010, and received approximately 2.2 million shares, which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The remaining shares and average price per share will be determined at the conclusion of the contract, which is expected to occur no later than August 2010. Contingencies From time to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does not indicate that the matters identified will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Page 30 of 97 Forward Looking Statements The company has made or implied certain forward looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the current global recession and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal and plastic container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the recent significant increases in resin, steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; regulatory action or federal and state legislation including mandated corporate governance and financial reporting laws; the effects of other restrictive packaging legislation, such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; boycotts; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; accounting changes; local economic conditions; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; regional and global pandemics; international business and market risks, such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates) in Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Argentine peso, and in the foreign exchange rate of the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar and Indian rupee; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of climate change, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process, particularly publicity concerning Bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of epoxy coatings applied to many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company); technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith, including the recent acquisition and related integration of four metal beverage can and end plants; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal control over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities.

The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports to the SEC. Page 31 of 97 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in respect of common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including that of its lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below. Commodity Price Risk We manage our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing. Most of the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2009 and in 2008, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur in 2010. In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These contracts include fixed price, floating and or pass through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes. Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the companys steel, aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated $3.5 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent, we estimate there could be a $12.3 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated $5.0 million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $2.3 million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Page 32 of 97 Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2009, included pay fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars. Pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate. Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2009, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $5.1 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars. Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2009, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $27.5 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. This amount includes the $12.3 million currency exposure discussed above in the Commodity Price Risk section. This hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $57.3 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Equity Price Risk The companys deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and, accordingly, is marked to market using the companys closing stock price at the end of a reporting period. Based on current share levels in the program, each $1 change in the companys stock price has an effect of $0.8 million on pretax earnings. As a way to partially reduce cash flow and earnings volatility, as well as stock price changes associated with our deferred compensation stock program, from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock. Mark to market accounting applies to these equity put options. Approximately $3.2 million of income was included in 2009 earnings to record the variance between the historical fair value and the current market value of outstanding equity put options. All of the outstanding options expired without value during August 2009. Page 33 of 97
