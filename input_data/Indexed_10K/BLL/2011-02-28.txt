Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this report, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing fa cts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation, Ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Business Overview Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers. We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Brazil and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a majo r customer or supplier, although our contracts and long term relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss. We are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other inputs into our direct costs. We reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. Over the past two years, we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations. To better realign capacity, we announced in 2010 the closure of our Richmond, British Columbia, plant and decided not to place into operations a plant in Lublin, Poland. In January 2011, we also announced that we will close our Torrance, California, plant and relocate a line from the Torrance plant to our Whitby, Ontario, plant. As part of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits. This ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household products customers. Page 17 of 100 While the North American metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the metal beverage container markets in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. We have been able to capitalize on growth by adding a plant, as well as additional capacity, in our consolidated Brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our European metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion. In October 2010, we announced that we are expanding production of our lightweight Alumi Tek bottle in our Golden, Colorado, facility, and in January 2011, we announced that we will commence specialty can production in our Fort Worth, T exas, plant. In February 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast Brazil, which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country. The new plant will be located in Alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early 2012. The output from the first line has been contracted under a long term agreement. In July 2010, we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring a leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions. To further capitalize on this new product line, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them. Balls consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance. We recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost, percentage of completion method of accounting. The 2010 contract mix consisted of approximately two thirds cost type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component, and approximately 25 percent fixed price contracts. The remainder represents time and material contracts, which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. The backlog at December 31, 2010, of $989 million consists of approximately 45 percent fixed price contracts, indicating a trend towards more fixed price business. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.s total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. Management Performance Measures Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities; free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment); and economic value added (net operating earnings after tax, as defined by the company, less a capital charge on net operating assets employed). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figur es; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog). We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of Ball and, because of that, we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the companys common stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various long term cash and stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball stock. Page 18 of 100 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Sales and Earnings ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 7,630.0 $ 6,710.4 $ 6,826.1 Net earnings from continuing operations 548.6 390.6 315.3 During 2010, we increased our investments in the growing Brazilian and PRC markets, initiated the consolidation of our salmon can production capacity, acquired a metal packaging related business in North America to expand our product portfolio and were awarded significant new contracts in our aerospace business. In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of a metal packaging business in Europe and announced plans to realign capacity in the U.S. and Canada by closing a beverage container manufacturing plant in California, relocating a 12 ounce can production line to a Canadian plant and expanding specialty can production in a Texas plant. Higher sales in 2010 were due largely to sales associated with current and prior year acquisitions and the consolidation of two joint ventures formerly accounted for as equity investments. The higher net earnings from continuing operations included $105.9 million of gains associated with the fair value on the previous equity investments due to the required purchase accounting. Effective June 2010, with the announced sale of the companys plastics packaging, Americas, business, the company has four reportable segments. After aggregating the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segments based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics, the four reportable segments are: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3) metal food and household products packaging, Americas; and (4) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S. and the PRC, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Business Segment Discussions Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 3,848.6 $ 2,888.8 $ 2,989.5 Segment earnings $ 418.3 $ 296.0 $ 284.1 Business consolidation costs (a) (6.8 ) (40.6 ) Total segment earnings $ 418.3 $ 289.2 $ 243.5 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008), Brazil (since August 2010) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold in the PRC. Balls acquisition of the remaining 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC, (JFP) was completed in June 2010. In August 2010, we acquired an additional economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture (Latapack Ball), and its results since the date of acquisition are consolidated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment as of that time. In October 2009, Ball acquired three metal beverage can manufacturing plants and on e beverage can end manufacturing plant from Anheuser Busch InBev n.v./s.a. (AB InBev). The acquisitions are discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Segment sales in 2010, as compared to 2009, were $959.8 million higher primarily due to the four plants acquired from AB InBev, additional sales associated with JFP and the consolidation of the Latapack Ball joint venture. Page 19 of 100 Segment sales were $100.7 million lower in 2009 than in 2008, primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by an increase in sales volumes. The higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from AB InBev, partially offset by certain plant closures and lower sales volumes in the existing business. Segment earnings in 2010 were $122.3 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net $85 million impact related to the higher sales volumes and $45 million of product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production. Also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a $7 million out of period inventory charge in 2009. The details of the out of period adjustment are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this report. Segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to $12 million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants and approximately $21 million of savings associated with plant closures. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes (excluding the newly acquired plants) and approximately $25 million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009. Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,697.6 $ 1,739.5 $ 1,868.7 Segment earnings $ 212.9 $ 214.8 $ 230.9 Business consolidation costs (a) (3.2 ) Total segment earnings $ 209.7 $ 214.8 $ 230.9 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in Europe. Ball Packaging Europe has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal beverage container business in Europe. Segment sales in 2010 decreased $41.9 million compared to 2009, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $93 million and price and mix changes, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Segment sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 were $129.2 million lower due to $110 million of unfavorable foreign exchange effects, partially offset by better commercial terms. Sales volumes in 2009 were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year. Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.9 million compared to 2009, primarily the result of a $28 million increase related to higher sales volumes, offset by $18 million of negative effects from foreign currency translation and $12 million of higher inventory and other costs. While 2009 sales volumes were consistent with the prior year, the adverse effects of foreign currency translation, both within Europe and on the conversion of the euro to the U.S. dollar, reduced segment earnings by $8 million. Also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into 2009 and a change in sales mix, partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts. On January 18, 2011, Ball acquired Aerocan S.A.S. (Aerocan), a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles, for 222.4 million (approximately $300 million) in cash and assumed debt. Aerocan manufactures extruded aluminum aerosol cans and bottles, and the aluminum slugs used to make them, for customers in the personal care, pharmaceutical, beverage and food industries. It operates three aerosol can manufacturing plants one each in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom and is a 51 percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug plant in France. The four plants employ approximately 560 people. The acquisition of Aerocan will allow Ball to enter a growing part of the metal packaging industry and to broaden the companys market development efforts into a ne w customer base. Page 20 of 100 Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,370.1 $ 1,392.9 $ 1,221.4 Segment earnings $ 129.1 $ 130.8 $ 68.1 Business consolidation gains (costs) (a) 18.3 (2.6 ) 1.6 Total segment earnings $ 147.4 $ 128.2 $ 69.7 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina that manufacture and sell metal food, aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs. In July 2010, the company acquired Neuman Aluminum (Neuman) for approximately $62 million in cash. Neuman is the leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions and is composed of two plants, one in the U.S. and one in Canada, that employ approximately 180 people. Segment sales in 2010 declined $22.8 million compared to 2009, largely the result of $88 million of lower commodity prices, partially offset by the sales associated with the Neuman plants. Segment sales in 2009 increased $171.5 million over 2008 due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in 2009, which were partially offset by an approximate $20 million decrease in sales volumes caused by the effects of the economic recession and Balls decision to not pursue low margin business. Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.7 million compared to 2009 primarily due to $44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 that did not occur in 2010, substantially offset by improved manufacturing and cost performance, favorable product sales mix and the addition of the Neuman plants. Segment earnings in 2009 were $62.7 million higher than in 2008 due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with $44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 and $22 million of improvements in manufacturing performance, partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of $7 million in 2008 not recurring in 2009. Aerospace and Technologies ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 713.7 $ 689.2 $ 746.5 Segment earnings $ 69.8 $ 61.4 $ 76.2 Gain on disposition (a) 7.1 Total segment earnings $ 69.8 $ 61.4 $ 83.3 (a) Further details of this item are included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing of services used primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries. Segment sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, increased by $24.5 million primarily due to increased scope on existing programs and new program starts, including WorldView 3 and several large classified programs. These increases were partially offset by the cancellation of the Orion program and the completion of several large programs, including Kepler and WorldView 2. Segment sales in 2009 were 8 percent lower than in 2008, driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft during 2009. Page 21 of 100 In addition to WorldView 3, some of the segments other high profile contracts include: the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Joint Polar Satellite System, the next generation satellite weather monitoring system; the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager, which will play an essential role in the Earths weather and environmental forecasting; and a number of antennas and sensors for the Joint Strike Fighter. Segment earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased by $8.4 million due to favorable fixed price program performance and higher sales, partially offset by the program reductions described above. Segment earnings in 2009 were down $14.8 million compared to 2008, primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity. On February 15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5 million, including cash sold of $1.8 million. The subsidiary provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million. Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2010, 94 percent in 2009 and 91 percent in 2008. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2010 and 2009, was $989 million and $518 million, respectively. The increase in backlog is primarily due to the awards of the WorldView 3 and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations. Discontinued Operations Plastic Packaging, Americas In August 2010, we completed the sale of our plastics packaging business and received gross proceeds of $280 million. This amount included $15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing but did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling $18.5 million paid in the fourth quarter. The sale of our plastics packaging business included five U.S. plants that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles, as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets. Our plastics business employed approximately 1,000 people and had sales of $635 million in 2009. The manufacturing plants were located in Ames, Iowa; Batavia, Illinois; Bellevue, Ohio; Chino, California; and Delran, New Jersey. The research and development operations were based in Broomfield and Westminster, Colorado. The following table summarizes the operating results for the discontinued operations for the years ended December 31: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 318.5 $ 634.9 $ 735.4 Earnings from operations $ 3.5 $ 19.6 $ 18.2 Gain on sale of business 8.6 Loss on asset impairment (107.1 ) Loss on business consolidation activities (a) (10.4 ) (23.1 ) (8.3 ) Gain on disposition 4.3 Tax benefit (provision) 30.5 (3.0 ) (5.3 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ (74.9 ) $ (2.2 ) $ 4.6 (a) Includes net charges recorded to reflect costs associated with the closure of plastics packaging manufacturing plants. Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Page 22 of 100 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $356.8 million, $309.0 million and $259.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 was primarily due to $26 million of higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation and stock based compensation costs, including mark to market adjustments for the companys deferred compensation stock plans, $15 million of nonrecurring gains in 2009 and $12 million of other higher costs, partially offset by $5 million of lower bad debt expense. The increases in SG&A expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of approximately $31 million of higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation costs, and higher stock based compensation costs; $13 million of gains in 2008 not recurring in 2009, including a $7 million claim settlement and $7 million of death benefit insurance proceeds; and $8 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts. These were offset by net favorable decreased costs of $12 million, including lower receivables securitization fees, legal expenses and research and development costs. Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $158.2 million in 2010, $117.2 million in 2009 and $137.7 million in 2008. Interest expense in 2010 included $8.8 million for the call premium and write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized issuance premiums related to the redemption of Balls senior notes due December 2012, as well as the refinancing of the senior credit facilities in December 2010. The higher expense in 2010 was also due to higher levels of debt, including the issuance of $700 million of senior notes in August 2009 and $500 million of senior notes in November 2010. The lower expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of the August 2009 senior notes. Based on current estimates, the 2011 effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31 percent. Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 was 29.0 percent compared to 29.8 percent in 2009 and 32.1 percent in 2008. The tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, included the accrual of a net $8 million tax benefit due to a change in the tax status of a foreign investment, a net $11.8 million benefit related to the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities and an increased U.S. manufacturing tax benefit, offset by a higher 2010 tax provision for uncertain tax positions and an $8.5 million tax benefit realized in 2009 on the sale of shares in a stock investment resulting from a basis difference. The lower tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a $4 million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement, legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward; an $8.5 million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investment due to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of $11 million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions. These benefits were partially offset by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions, lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes. Results of Equity Affiliates In August 2010, Ball acquired an additional 10.1 percent economic interest in its Brazilian beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack Ball, increasing the companys overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 60.1 percent. In connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in Latapack Ball, we recorded a gain of $81.8 million on the fair value of the previously held 50 percent equity ownership as a result of required purchase accounting. In June 2010, we acquired Jianlibaos 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC. We had owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992. We acquired the 65 percent interest for $86.9 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and assumed debt, and also entered into a long term supply agreement with Jianlibao and one of its affiliates. We recorded equity earnings of $24.1 million, which was composed of equity earnings and a gain realized on the fair value of Balls previous 35 percent equity investment as a result of required purchase accounting. CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Page 23 of 100 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, including discontinued operations $ 515.2 $ 559.7 $ 627.6 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, including discontinued operations (110.2 ) (581.4 ) (418.0 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (459.6 ) 100.8 (205.5 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a use of $250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program. At December 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the companys adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective January 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, resulting in a $250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow fr om operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at December 31, 2010. Excluding the $250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $765.2 million in 2010 compared to $559.7 million in 2009 and $627.6 million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $70 million to a customer for a legal settlement. Management Performance Measures The following financial measurements are on a non U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Non U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this report. Free Cash Flow Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to plan stock buyback levels, (3) to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Page 24 of 100 Based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations $ 515.2 $ 559.7 $ 627.6 Adjust for increase in accounts receivable due to change in accounting for securitization program 250.0 Capital spending, including discontinued operations (259.4 ) (187.1 ) (306.9 ) Free cash flow $ 505.8 $ 372.6 $ 320.7 Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2011 to be in excess of $900 million, capital spending to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be more than $400 million. In 2011 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continuing our stock repurchases and funding our capital spending programs. Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA and Ratios Management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) and adjusted net earnings to evaluate the companys performance. EBIT, EBITDA and net earnings are typically derived directly from the companys consolidated statement of earnings; however, they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Based on the above definitions, our calculation of adjusted EBIT is summarized below: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), as reported $ 764.6 $ 653.8 $ 580.6 Business consolidation activities (11.0 ) 21.4 43.8 Gain on dispositions (34.8 ) (7.1 ) Adjusted EBIT $ 753.6 $ 640.4 $ 617.3 Our calculations of adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted EBIT to interest ratio and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio are summarized below: ($ in millions, except ratios) 2010 2009 2008 Adjusted EBIT (as calculated above) $ 753.6 $ 640.4 $ 617.3 Add depreciation and amortization 265.5 243.1 249.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,019.1 $ 883.5 $ 867.2 Interest expense (excluding debt refinancing costs) $ 149.4 $ 117.2 $ 137.7 Total debt at December 31 (a) $ 2,812.3 $ 2,596.2 $ 2,410.1 Less cash (152.0 ) (210.6 ) (127.4 ) Net Debt $ 2,660.3 $ 2,385.6 $ 2,282.7 Adjusted EBIT/Interest coverage 5.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 x Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA 2.6 x 2.7 x 2.6 x (a) Debt amounts at December 31, 2009 and 2008, do not include amounts borrowed under the companys off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program of $250.0 million at each period end. Page 25 of 100 Our calculation of adjusted net earnings is summarized below: ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation, as reported $ 468.0 $ 387.9 $ 319.5 Discontinued operations, net of tax 74.9 2.2 (4.6 ) Business consolidation activities, net of tax (9.3 ) 13.0 27.1 Gains and equity earnings related to acquisitions, net of tax (105.9 ) Gain on dispositions, net of tax (30.7 ) (4.4 ) Debt refinancing costs, net of tax 5.3 Adjusted net earnings $ 433.0 $ 372.4 $ 337.6 Per diluted share from continuing operations, as reported $ 2.96 $ 2.05 $ 1.62 Per diluted share, as adjusted 2.36 1.96 1.74 Debt Facilities and Refinancing Interest bearing debt at December 31, 2010, increased $216.1 million to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009. In December 2010, Ball replaced its senior credit facilities due October 2011 with new senior credit facilities due December 2015. The senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include a $200 million Term A loan denominated in U.S. dollars, a 51 million Term B loan denominated in British sterling and a 100 million Term C loan denominated in euros. The facilities also include (1) a multi currency, long term revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to approximately $850 million and (2) a French multi currency revolving facility that provides the company with up to $150 million. The revolving cr edit facilities expire in December 2015. In November 2010, Ball issued $500 million of new 5.75 percent senior notes due in May 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the borrowings under our Term D loan facility and for general corporate purposes. In March 2010, Ball issued $500 million of new 6.75 percent senior notes due in September 2020. On that same date, the company issued a notice of redemption to call $509 million in 6.875 percent senior notes due December 2012 at a redemption price of 101.146 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. The redemption of the bonds occurred on April 21, 2010, and resulted in a charge of $8.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamor tized premiums. The charge is included in the 2010 statement of earnings as a component of interest expense. At December 31, 2010, approximately $976 million was available under the companys committed multi currency revolving credit facilities. The companys PRC operations also had approximately $20 million available under a committed credit facility of approximately $52 million. In addition to the long term committed credit facilities, the company had $372 million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2010, of which $76.2 million was outstanding and due on demand, as well as approximately $175 million of available borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization program. In October 2010, the company renewed its receivables sales agreement for a period of one year. The size of the new program will vary between a maximum of $125 million for settlement dates in January through April and a maximum of $175 million for settlement dates in the remaining months. Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until December 2015, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis. We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2010, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Notes 12 and 6, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Page 26 of 100 Other Liquidity Items Cash payments required for long term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2010, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due By Period (a) ($ in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt, including capital leases $ 2,750.1 $ 34.5 $ 188.3 $ 367.1 $ 2,160.2 Interest payments on long term debt (b) 1,267.5 160.5 316.4 304.2 486.4 Operating leases 93.2 31.1 37.1 16.6 8.4 Purchase obligations (c) 6,586.9 2,709.5 3,779.4 98.0 Total payments on contractual obligations $ 10,697.7 $ 2,935.6 $ 4,321.2 $ 785.9 $ 2,655.0 (a) Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end 2010 exchange rates. (b) For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments. (c) The companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly. The table above does not include $60.1 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is uncertain. Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be in the range of $30 million in 2011. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $71.4 million, $74.0 million, $77.1 million, $80.3 million and $84.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2011 through 2015, respectively, and a total of $483.1 million for the years 2016 through 2020. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be between $21.8 million (16.5 million) to $23.2 million (17.5 million) in each of the years 2011 through 2015 and a total of $102.7 mill ion (77.5 million) for the years 2016 through 2020. For the U.S. pension plans in 2011, we changed our return on asset assumption to 8.00 percent (from 8.25 percent in 2010) and our discount rate assumption to an average of 5.55 percent (from 6.00 percent in 2010). Based on the changes in assumptions, pension expense in 2011 is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to 2010. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $2.9 million increase in the 2011 global pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $3.5 million of additional pension expense in 2011. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note 14 accompanying the consolida ted financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 20 cents per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Total dividends paid were $35.8 million in 2010, $37.4 million in 2009 and $37.5 million in 2008. On January 26, 2011, the companys board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividends to 7 cents per share. Share Repurchases Our share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $506.7 million in 2010, $5.1 million in 2009 and $299.6 million in 2008. On November 2, 2010, we acquired 2,775,408 shares of our publicly held common stock in a private transaction for $88.8 million. On February 17, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $125.0 million of our common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. We advanced the $125.0 million on February 22, 2010, and received 4,323,598 shares, which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on May 20, 2010, and the company received an additional 398,206 shares. Net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 1,350,000 shares. From January 1 through February 24, 2011, Ball repurchased an additional $143.3 million of its common stock. Page 27 of 100 Contingencies The company is subject to routine litigation incident to operating its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. The companys information indicates that the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the companys legal proceedings are included in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements The company has made or implied certain forward looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insuf ficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the current global recession and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the increases in steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; the number and timing of the purchas es of the companys common shares; the effects of other restrictive packaging legislation, such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; international business and market ris ks, such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates) in Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Czech koruna, and in the foreign exchange rate of the euro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws affecting the company or its customers or suppliers, or any of their respective products, including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of climate change, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process, particularly publicity c oncerning Bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of epoxy coatings applied to many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company); technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith, including the recent disposition of our plastics business and the recent Neuman Aluminum acquisition; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal control over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports to the SEC. Page 28 of 100 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in respect of common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including that of its lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below. Commodity Price Risk We manage our commodity price risk in the Americas in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our aluminum packaging related net sales in the Americas. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing. In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales contracts that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These contracts include fixed price, floating and or pass through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes. Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, steel packaging related sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2010 and in 2009, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that may occur in 2011. Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the companys steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated $2.7 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Additionally, the company has foreign currency exposures on raw materials, and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total foreign currency exposure discussed below. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated $5.2 million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $0.7 million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Page 29 of 100 Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we may use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2010, included pay fixed interest rate swaps, which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2010, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $4.5 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, Serbian dinar and Czech koruna. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts ar e negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars. Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2010, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $27.3 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. This hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $24.3 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Equity Price Risk The companys deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and, accordingly, is marked to market using the companys closing stock price at the end of a reporting period. Based on current share levels in the program, each $1 change in the companys stock price has an effect of $1.7 million on pretax earnings. Page 30 of 100
