Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation, Ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Business Overview Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers. We sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the PRC, Brazil and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in the U.S. and Vietnam. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. Over the past few years, we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our global operations. To better realign capacity, in 2011 we closed our Torrance, California, U.S., facility; relocated one of the lines to our Whitby, Ontario, Canada, facility; relocated one line from Lublin, Poland, to our Belgrade, Serbia, facility; reduced capacity in our Columbus, Ohio, U.S., metal beverage facility and redeployed surplus equipment to other global locations. As part of our Drive for 10 vision, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. We have been placing additional emphasis on technology and innovation throughout our businesses during 2011 and will continue to do so in 2012 and beyond. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits, as well as increasing the use of recycled content and lightweighting of our packages. This ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food, personal care and household products customers. Our sustainability vision encompasses balancing economic, environmental and social impacts in our decision making and activities. Successfully executing this vision will create long term, shared value for our stakeholders, and Ball is committed to practicing sustainability as a way of doing business. Our sustainability report and updates on our progress are available at www.ball.com/sustainability. The North American metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years. As a result, we have reduced our excess capacity in certain North American metal beverage facilities for those containers. The metal beverage container industries in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. We have been able to capitalize on this growth by adding a facility, as well as additional capacity, in our Latapack Ball, consolidated Brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our European metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up 18 Table of Contents certain lines and by expansion. In 2011, we expanded our lightweight Alumi Tek bottle production to our Golden, Colorado, facility, and we commenced specialty can production in our Fort Worth, Texas, U.S., facility. We also announced that Latapack Ball would construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing facility in Alagoinhas, Bahia, which is in northeast Brazil, one of the fastest growing regions of the country. The new facility will begin production in early 2012. The output from the first line has been contracted for sale under a long term agreement. Additionally, in March 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with Thai Beverage Can Limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in Vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012. We have also made recent strategic acquisitions. In October 2011, we acquired our partners interests in QMCP and recorded a gain of $9.2 million related to our previously held interest in the joint venture. Additionally, we are constructing a new expanded beverage container facility for QMCP that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012. In July 2010, we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring the leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol containers, beverage bottles, collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions. To further expand this new product line and broaden our market development efforts into a new customer base, in January 2011, we acquired a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol containers and bottles and the slugs used to make them. Further details of recent acquisitions are included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. We recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage of completion under the cost to cost method of accounting. The 2011 contract mix consisted of approximately 60 percent cost type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component, and 33 percent fixed price contracts. The remainder represents time and material contracts, which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. The contracted backlog at December 31, 2011, of approximately $897 million consisted of approximately 50 percent fixed price contracts indicating a continuing trend towards more fixed price business. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. Management Performance Measures Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog). 19 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Sales and Earnings ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 8,630.9 $ 7,630.0 $ 6,710.4 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation 444.0 468.0 387.9 The increase in net sales in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven largely by the increase in demand for metal packaging in the PRC, improved beverage container volumes in the Americas, the consolidation of Latapack Ball, the acquisition of two PRC joint ventures and the extruded aluminum businesses, and improved aerospace program performance. In addition to the business segment performance analyzed below, net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation included discontinued operations related to the sale of the plastics business in August 2010, business consolidation costs, debt refinancing costs, and the equity earnings and gains on the acquisitions. These items are detailed in the Management Performance Measures section below. Higher sales in 2010 compared to 2009 were due largely to sales associated with 2010 business acquisitions described above. The higher net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 included $105.9 million of equity gains on acquisitions associated with the acquisitions. Business Segment Discussions The company has four reportable segments: (1) metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia (aggregated based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics); (2) metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3) metal food and household products packaging, Americas; and (4) aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S. and Vietnam, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 4,415.8 $ 3,850.4 $ 2,891.1 Segment earnings $ 481.7 $ 418.3 $ 296.0 Business consolidation costs (a) (11.0 ) (6.8 ) Total segment earnings $ 470.7 $ 418.3 $ 289.2 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Brazil (since August 2010) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging, as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the PRC. Our acquisition of the remaining 60 percent interest in QMCP was completed in October 2011, and our acquisition of our partners 65 percent interest in JFP was completed in June 2010. In August 2010, we acquired an additional economic interest in Latapack Ball. The results of the acquired entities have been included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment since the acquisition dates. The acquisitions are discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Segment sales in 2011 were $565.4 million higher compared to 2010 attributable mainly to $268 million from the consolidation of Latapack Ball and the acquisition of two PRC joint ventures, $190 million from higher sales volumes and $96 million from higher commodity input prices. Segment sales in 2010 were $959.3 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to the four facilities acquired from AB InBev, additional sales associated with JFP and the consolidation of the Latapack Ball joint venture since August 2010. 20 Table of Contents Segment earnings in 2011 were $63.4 million higher than in 2010 due to $45 million from the consolidation of Latapack Ball and the acquisition of two PRC joint venture interests, $35 million from higher sales volumes and $16 million from improved manufacturing performance, partially offset by $38 million of higher manufacturing and distribution costs. Segment earnings in 2010 were $122.3 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net $85 million impact from higher sales volumes and $45 million from product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production. Also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a $7 million out of period inventory charge in 2009. The details of the out of period adjustment are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this annual report. Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 2,017.6 $ 1,699.1 $ 1,739.5 Segment earnings $ 243.7 $ 213.5 $ 214.8 Business consolidation costs (a) (14.1 ) (3.2 ) Total segment earnings $ 229.6 $ 210.3 $ 214.8 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes the manufacture of metal beverage containers, extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs. Ball has manufacturing facilities located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia and the Czech Republic. In January 2011, Ball acquired Aerocan S.A.S. (Aerocan), a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol containers and bottles, for 221.7 million ($295.2 million) in cash and assumed debt, which is net of $26.2 million of cash acquired. Aerocan manufactures extruded aluminum aerosol containers and bottles, and the aluminum slugs used to make them, for customers in the personal care, pharmaceutical, beverage and food industries. It operates three aerosol container manufacturing facilities one each in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom and is a 51 percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug facility in France. The acquisition of Aerocan has enabled Ball to expand into a new product category that is growing faster than other parts of our business, and to align with a new customer base at returns that meet or exceed the companys cost of capital. Segment sales in 2011 increased $318.5 million compared to 2010 due to $180 million from the inclusion of Aerocan sales, $100 million from the effect of currency exchange rates and $31 million from higher sales volumes. Segment sales in 2010 decreased $40.4 million compared to 2009, primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange effects of $93 million and price and mix changes, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Segment earnings in 2011 increased $30.2 million compared to 2010 due to $38 million earnings contribution from the Aerocan acquisition, $13 million from the effect of currency exchange rates and $13 million from higher volumes, partially offset by $35 million from higher inventory and other costs. Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.3 million compared to 2009, primarily due to the result of a $28 million increase from higher sales volumes, offset by $18 million from negative effects from currency translation and $12 million of higher inventory and other costs. 21 Table of Contents Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 1,426.4 $ 1,370.1 $ 1,392.9 Segment earnings $ 133.7 $ 129.1 $ 130.8 Business consolidation costs (a) (1.9 ) 18.3 (2.6 ) Total segment earnings $ 131.8 $ 147.4 $ 128.2 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina that manufacture and sell metal food, aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as decorative specialty containers and, with the July 2010 acquisition of Neuman Aluminum, aluminum slugs. Segment sales in 2011 increased $56.3 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of aluminum slug sales associated with the Neuman facilities of $108 million and improved pricing and sales mix, partially offset by $73 million from lower can sales volumes. Segment sales in 2010 declined $22.8 million compared to 2009, largely the result of $88 million from lower commodity prices, partially offset by the sales associated with the Neuman facilities. Segment earnings in 2011 increased $4.6 million compared to 2010 mainly due to the year over year impact of lower cost inventory of $16 million in 2011, contribution from a full year of aluminum slug sales and improved pricing and sales mix, partially offset by lower sales volumes of $16 million and unfavorable manufacturing performance due to higher fourth quarter 2011 production curtailments. Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.7 million compared to 2009 primarily due to $44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 that did not occur in 2010, substantially offset by improved manufacturing and cost performance, favorable product sales mix and the addition of the Neuman facilities. Aerospace and Technologies ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 784.6 $ 713.7 $ 689.2 Segment earnings 79.6 69.8 61.4 The aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and providing services used in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries. Segment sales in 2011 increased $70.9 million compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales from U.S. national defense contracts and existing commercial programs, partially offset by lower sales from civil space programs. Segment sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, increased by $24.5 million primarily due to increased scope on existing programs and new program starts, including WorldView 3 and several large classified programs. These increases were partially offset by the cancellation of the Orion program and the completion of several large programs, including Kepler and WorldView 2. In addition to WorldView 3, some of the segments other high profile contracts include: the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Joint Polar Satellite System, the next generation satellite weather monitoring system; the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager, which will play an essential role in the Earths weather and environmental forecasting; and a number of antennas and sensors for the Joint Strike Fighter. Segment earnings in 2011, as compared to 2010, increased $9.8 million due to increased sales volume, improved performance on fixed price contracts and better award fees on several of our large cost plus contracts. Segment earnings in 2010, as compared to 2009, increased by $8.4 million due to favorable fixed price program performance and higher sales, partially offset by the program reductions described above. 22 Table of Contents Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2011, 96 percent in 2010 and 94 percent in 2009. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December 31, 2011 and 2010, was $897 million and $989 million, respectively. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts and funding of programs. Discontinued Operations Plastic Packaging, Americas In August 2010, we completed the sale of our plastics packaging, Americas, business to Amcor Limited and received proceeds of $258.7 million, which included $15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing and is net of post closing adjustments of $21.3 million. The sale of our plastics packaging business included five U.S. facilities that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles, as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets. The following table summarizes the operating results for the discontinued operations for the years ended December 31: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ $ 318.5 $ 634.9 Earnings from operations $ $ 3.5 $ 19.6 Gain (loss) on sale of business (0.8 ) 8.6 Loss on asset impairment (107.1 ) Loss on business consolidation activities (a) (3.0 ) (10.4 ) (23.1 ) Gain on disposition 4.3 Tax benefit (provision) 1.5 30.5 (3.0 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ (2.3 ) $ (74.9 ) $ (2.2 ) (a) Includes net charges recorded to reflect costs associated with the closure of plastics packaging manufacturing facilities. Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $381.4 million in 2011, $356.8 million in 2010 and $309.0 million in 2009. The increase in SG&A in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to $9 million from unfavorable currency exchange effects, the consolidation of our acquisitions and other individually insignificant higher costs. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to $26 million from higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation and stock based compensation, and fair value adjustments for the companys deferred compensation stock plans, $15 million from nonrecurring gains in 2009 and $12 million of other higher costs, partially offset lower bad debt expense. 23 Table of Contents Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $177.1 million in 2011, $158.2 million in 2010 and $117.2 million in 2009. The higher interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010, excluding debt refinancing costs, was due to higher levels of debt related to the acquisitions of Aerocan, JFP and Neuman, the consolidation of Latapack Ball and higher share repurchases, as well as the refinancing of the companys bank credit facilities in December 2010. The higher expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher levels of debt, including the issuance of $500 million of senior notes in November 2010 and $700 million of senior notes in August 2009. Interest expense in 2010 included $8.8 million for the call premium and write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized issuance premiums related to the redemption of Balls senior notes due December 2012, as well as the refinancing of our senior credit facilities in December 2010. The increase in the 2011 full year effective income tax rate of 30.5 percent as compared to 2010 of 29.0 percent was primarily due to significant discrete period tax benefits in 2010 not recurring in 2011 related to a change in entity status of a foreign subsidiary and the 2010 world wide debt refinancing. The impact of these two non recurring items was partially offset by a lower 2011 effective income tax rate on foreign earnings, primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of Brazils results and the acquisition of Aerocan, both of which have income tax holidays. The tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, included the accrual of a net $8 million tax benefit due to a change in the tax status of a foreign investment, a net $11.8 million benefit related to the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities and increased U.S. manufacturing tax benefits, offset by a higher 2010 tax provision for uncertain tax positions and an $8.5 million tax benefit realized in 2009 on the sale of shares in a stock investment resulting from a basis difference. Results of Equity Affiliates In October 2011, we acquired our partners 60 percent equity interests in QMCP, and recorded a gain of $9.2 million on the fair value of our previously held equity ownership as a result of the required purchased accounting. Additionally, in March 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with Thai Beverage Can Limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in Vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012. In August 2010, we acquired an additional 10.1 percent economic interest in our Brazilian beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack Ball, increasing our overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 60.1 percent. In connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in Latapack Ball, we recorded a gain of $81.8 million on the fair value of the previously held 50 percent equity ownership as a result of the required purchase accounting. In June 2010, we acquired our partners 65 percent interest in JFP for $86.9 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and assumed debt, and also entered into a long term supply agreement. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded equity earnings of $24.1 million, which was composed of equity earnings, gains on the forgiveness of debt and guarantees and a gain realized on the fair value of Balls equity investment as a result of the required purchase accounting. 24 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, including discontinued operations $ 948.4 $ 515.2 $ 559.7 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, including discontinued operations (738.0 ) (110.2 ) (581.4 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (216.8 ) (459.6 ) 100.8 Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included $250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program. At December 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the adoption of prospective accounting guidance effective January 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable, which resulted in a $250 million working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Cash flows from operations were $948.4 million in 2011 compared to $765.2 million in 2010 (excluding the $250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above) and $559.7 million in 2009. Higher operating cash flows in 2011 compared to 2010 were due primarily to higher earnings before interest and taxes, favorable working capital changes, the consolidation of Latapack Ball and lower pension funding. The significant improvement in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 28 cents per share in 2011 and 20 cents per share in 2010 and 2009. Total dividends paid were $45.7 million in 2011, $35.8 million in 2010 and $37.4 million in 2009. On January 25, 2012, the companys board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 10 cents per share beginning with the March 15, 2012, payment date. Share Repurchases The companys share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $473.9 million in 2011, $506.7 million in 2010 and $5.1 million in 2009. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. Additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in Note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. On February 1, 2012, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $200 million of our common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $200 million on February 3, 2012, and received 4,584,819 shares, which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the closing price on January 31, 2011, of $39.26. The final number of shares will be determined based on the volume weighted average trading price of the companys shares over an agreed upon period of time. 25 Table of Contents Debt Facilities and Refinancing The senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include a $195 million Term A loan denominated in U.S. dollars, a 50 million Term B loan denominated in British sterling and a 99 million Term C loan denominated in euros. The facilities also include a long term, multi currency committed revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 billion. Total interest bearing debt of $3.1 billion at December 31, 2011, was higher than the amount outstanding at December 31, 2010, of $2.8 billion. The increase in debt was due primarily to the companys acquisition of Aerocan for approximately $300 million as all free cash flow was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In November 2010, Ball issued $500 million of new 5.75 percent senior notes due in May 2021, and in March 2010, Ball issued $500 million of new 6.75 percent senior notes due in September 2020. On April 21, 2010, the company redeemed $509 million of 6.875 percent senior notes due December 2012 at a redemption price of 101.146 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. The redemption resulted in a charge of $8.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums. An additional $0.7 million of charges were recorded in connection with the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities in 2010. The charges are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements. In August 2011, the company entered into an accounts receivable securitization agreement for a term of three years. The maximum the company can borrow under this agreement may vary between $150 million and $275 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the companys North American packaging businesses. At December 31, 2011, $231.0 million of accounts receivable have been sold under this agreement. Borrowings under the securitization agreement are included within the short term debt and current portion of long term debt line on the balance sheet. There were no accounts receivable sold at December 31, 2010, under the companys previous securitization program. At December 31, 2011, taking into account outstanding letters of credit, approximately $1 billion was available under the companys committed multi currency revolving credit facilities. In addition to these long term committed credit facilities, the company had approximately $465 million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2011, of which $148.6 million was outstanding and due on demand. Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until December 2015, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. While ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis. We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2011, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Note 12, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Other Liquidity Measures The following financial measurements are on a non U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. Non U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this annual report. Free Cash Flow Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to plan stock buyback levels and (3) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. 26 Table of Contents Based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations $ 948.4 $ 515.2 $ 559.7 Adjust for increase in accounts receivable due to change in accounting for securitization program 250.0 Capital spending, including discontinued operations (443.8 ) (259.4 ) (187.1 ) Free cash flow $ 504.6 $ 505.8 $ 372.6 Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2012 to be in excess of $850 million, capital spending to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $450 million. In 2012, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continue to fund our stock repurchases, dividend payments, growth capital projects and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. Comparable EBIT, Comparable Net Earnings, Comparable EBITDA and Ratios Management internally uses comparable earnings before interest and taxes (comparable EBIT), comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (comparable EBITDA) and comparable earnings to evaluate the companys operating performance. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. EBIT, EBITDA and net earnings are typically derived directly from the companys statements of earnings; however, they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Based on the above definitions, our calculation of comparable EBIT is summarized below: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Earnings before taxes, as reported $ 659.8 $ 606.4 $ 536.6 Interest expense 177.1 158.2 117.2 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 836.9 764.6 653.8 Business consolidation activities 30.3 (11.0 ) 21.4 Gain on disposition (34.8 ) Comparable EBIT $ 867.2 $ 753.6 $ 640.4 Our calculations of comparable EBITDA, the comparable EBIT to interest ratio and the net debt to comparable EBITDA ratio are summarized below: ($ in millions, except ratios) 2011 2010 2009 Comparable EBIT (as calculated above) $ 867.2 $ 753.6 $ 640.4 Add depreciation and amortization 301.1 265.5 243.1 Comparable EBITDA $ 1,168.3 $ 1,019.1 $ 883.5 Interest expense (excluding debt refinancing cost) $ 177.1 $ 149.4 $ 117.2 Total debt at December 31 (a) $ 3,144.1 $ 2,812.3 $ 2,596.2 Less cash (165.8 ) (152.0 ) (210.6 ) Net Debt $ 2,978.3 $ 2,660.3 $ 2,385.6 Comparable EBIT/Interest 4.9x 5.0x 5.5x Net Debt/Comparable EBITDA 2.5x 2.6x 2.7x (a) Debt amounts at December 31, 2009, do not include amounts borrowed under the companys off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program of $250.0 million. 27 Table of Contents Our calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below: ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation, as reported $ 444.0 $ 468.0 $ 387.9 Discontinued operations, net of tax 2.3 74.9 2.2 Business consolidation and other activities, net of tax 22.5 (9.3 ) 13.0 Equity earnings and gains related to acquisitions, net of tax (9.2 ) (105.9 ) Debt refinancing costs, net of tax 5.3 Gain on disposition, net of tax (30.7 ) Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation before above transactions (Comparable Earnings) $ 459.6 $ 433.0 $ 372.4 Per diluted share from continuing operations, as reported $ 2.64 $ 2.96 $ 2.05 Per diluted share, as adjusted $ 2.73 $ 2.36 $ 1.96 Commitments Cash payments required for long term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December 31, 2011, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due By Period (a) ($ in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt, including capital leases $ 2,776.4 $ 67.8 $ 300.3 $ 618.8 $ 1,789.5 Interest payments on long term debt (b) 1,128.0 160.5 323.6 292.8 351.1 Operating leases 86.0 29.5 38.5 13.6 4.4 Purchase obligations (c) 4,358.5 2,410.0 1,851.7 96.8 Total payments on contractual obligations $ 8,348.9 $ 2,667.8 $ 2,514.1 $ 1,022.0 $ 2,145.0 (a) Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end 2011 exchange rates. (b) For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company. (c) The companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. Also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly. The table above does not include $68.8 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time. Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be in the range of $120 million in 2012. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $113.7 million, $76.6 million, $80.2 million, $84.2 million and $87.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2012 through 2016, respectively, and a total of $496.7 million for the years 2017 through 2021. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be between $21 million (16 million) and $22 million (17 million) in each of the years 2012 through 2016 and a total of $98 million (76 million) for the years 2017 through 2021. For the U.S. pension plans in 2012, we revised our return on asset assumption to 7.75 percent (from 8.00 percent in 2011) and our discount rate assumption to an average of 4.75 percent (from 5.55 percent in 2011). Based on these changes in assumptions and revisions based on plan experience studies, U.S. pension expense in 2012 is anticipated to be approximately $6 million higher than in 2011. Taking into consideration higher pension funding in 2012, a further reduction of the expected return on U.S. pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $3.1 million increase in the 2012 global pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $4.5 million of additional pension expense in 2012. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. 28 Table of Contents Due to the U.S. tax status of certain of Balls subsidiaries in Canada and the PRC, the company annually provides U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. In 2010, Ball increased its economic interest in its Brazilian joint venture, and due to the nature of the investment, Ball provides deferred taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of the Brazil investment related to this incremental investment. Net U.S. taxes provided for Brazil, Canada and PRC earnings in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $17.7 million, $13.4 million and $16.6 million, respectively. For the foreseeable future, anticipated cash flow from the U.S. operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt service, including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years. Should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events, Ball can access funds in the U.S. to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility, from public bond markets, from cash deposits in the PRC on earnings for which U.S. taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding U.S. loans to foreign subsidiaries. Consequently, managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of Balls remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no U.S. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings; however, repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate. Contingencies The company is subject to routine litigation incident to operating its businesses, and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. The companys information indicates that the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the companys legal proceedings are included in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. 29 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The company has made or implied certain forward looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the ongoing global recession and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the increases in steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; the number and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; the effects of restrictive legislation, including with respect to packaging, such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; political and economic instability, including periodic sell off on global equity markets, sanctions and the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies; business risks with respect to changes in currency exchange rates; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws affecting the company or its customers or suppliers, or any of their respective products, including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of climate change, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process, particularly publicity concerning Bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of epoxy coatings applied to many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company); technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal control over financial reporting; ongoing uncertainties surrounding sovereign debt of various European countries, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, as well as ratings agency downgrades of various governments debt; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by national and local tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K reports to the SEC. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce Balls exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock and the companys deferred compensation stock plan. However, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. We monitor counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. Further details are available in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below. Commodity Price Risk Aluminum We manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods. First, we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial supply contracts for the purchase of aluminum products. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing. Second, we generally use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing. Steel Most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price changes that may occur in 2012. Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the companys steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated $4.8 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Additionally, the company has currency exposures on raw materials, and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated $8.2 million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $0.3 million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we may use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2011, included pay fixed interest rate swaps. Pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. 31 Table of Contents Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2011, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $8.1 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes. Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times Ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys net earnings. Our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not an exchange pass through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures. Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2011, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $44.8 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period. This hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $24.8 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Common Stock Price Risk The companys deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and, accordingly, is marked to fair value using the companys closing stock price at the end of a reporting period. Based on current share levels in the program, each $1 change in the companys stock price has an impact of $1.8 million on pretax earnings. During March and September 2011, the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the companys exposure to these fair value fluctuations. 32 Table of Contents
