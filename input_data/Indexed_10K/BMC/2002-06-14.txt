ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION INTRODUCTION This section includes historical information, certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading "Certain Risks and Uncertainties " about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others. It is important that the business discussion in Item 1 of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties, and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on going basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, acquired in process research and development, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and marketable securities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that 9 are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses, the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. The critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments listed above are discussed further throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. HISTORICAL INFORMATION Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income (loss) or net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating margins, see the discussions below under the heading "Certain Risks and Uncertainties." Acquisitions In April 1999, we acquired New Dimension Software Ltd. (New Dimension) in a cash tender offer. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly, New Dimensions financial results have been included in our fiscal 2000 financial results since the acquisition date. In April 2000, we acquired Evity, Inc. (Evity) for 1.6 million shares of common stock and cash of $10.0 million. Stock options to purchase 0.4 million common shares were issued to replace outstanding Evity stock options. In August 2000, we acquired OptiSystems Solutions, Ltd. (OptiSystems) for cash. These transactions, along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions, were accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the percentages that selected items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) bear to total revenues.

We generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products, support and services are sold to our customers. We recognize revenue in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition" and SOP 98 9, "Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions." These statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions. In applying these statements, we recognize software license fees upon meeting the following four criteria: execution of the signed contract, delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer, determination that the software license fees are fixed and determinable, and determination that collection of the software license fees is probable. In instances when any one of the four criteria are not met, we will either defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met or will recognize the software license revenue on a ratable basis, as required by SOPs 97 2 and 98 9. Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis. Revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment. We have an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. Further, the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity. Revenues from sales through agents, distributors and resellers are recorded either at the gross amount charged the customer or net of commissions paid, based on the economic risks and ongoing product support responsibilities we assume. Revenues from professional services are typically recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts, or on a percentage of completion basis. When several elements, including software licenses, maintenance, enhancement and support and professional services, are sold to a customer through a single contract, the revenues from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based upon the residual method, whereby the fair value of the undelivered elements of the contract is deferred. We have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance, enhancement and support and professional services. Accordingly, software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance, enhancement and support and or professional services, and where the maintenance, enhancement and support and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software. In those instances where professional services are essential to the functionality of the software licenses, contract accounting is applied to both the software license and services elements of the arrangement. In the event a contract contains terms which are inconsistent with our vendor specific objective evidence, all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis. Based on our interpretation of SOP 97 2 and SOP 98 9, we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. However, the AICPA and its Software Revenue Recognition Task Force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the SEC. Future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 11 PERCENTAGE CHANGE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 2002 COMPARED TO COMPARED TO 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 (IN MILLIONS) License: North America ............................. $ 777.7 $ 483.5 $ 351.4 (37.8)% (27.3)% International ............................. 402.5 408.7 273.6 1.5% (33.1)% Total license revenues .................. 1,180.2 892.2 625.0 (24.4)% (29.9)% Maintenance: North America ............................. 294.5 330.8 355.2 12.3% 7.4% International ............................. 191.2 193.3 220.6 1.1% 14.1% Total maintenance revenues .............. 485.7 524.1 575.8 7.9% 9.9% Professional services: North America ............................. 32.3 53.2 45.8 64.7% (13.9)% International ............................. 21.0 40.1 42.3 91.0% 5.5% Total professional services revenues .... 53.3 93.3 88.1 75.0% (5.6)% Total revenues ........................ $1,719.2 $1,509.6 $1,288.9 (12.2)% (14.6)% The total revenue decline of 12% in fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from a decrease in enterprise license transactions during the year and a reduction in license upgrade fees as discussed under Product License Revenues below. Demand weakness was experienced across the board during fiscal 2001 by independent software vendors with mainframe product portfolios. We believe that this indicates that external market factors contributed significantly to this weakness. While it is impossible to assign weights to any individual factors, market factors that may have contributed to this weakness and the resultant negative effect on license revenues experienced by us and our competitors included uncertainties associated with the roll out of IBMs Z series mainframe product family and workload based pricing model and continued customer absorption of capacity purchased in association with Year 2000 compliance programs. These factors also impacted revenues for our other products because many of our mainframe customers are also customers of our other products and sometimes purchase these other products together with mainframe products in enterprise solutions. Revenues from companies we acquired in purchase accounting transactions during fiscal 2001 did not provide a significant offset to the revenue declines discussed above. Total revenues declined 15% in fiscal 2002. Continued absorption of prepaid capacity and difficult economic conditions in domestic and international markets throughout fiscal 2002 have resulted in reduced information technology spending by many of our customers. Though the number of license transactions declined only 4% during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, tighter budgets and higher required approval levels caused many customers to enter into smaller transactions in terms of dollar value. Fiscal 2002 revenues were also impacted by the deferral of $112.0 million of license revenue due to certain flexible terms and conditions included in a number of customer agreements. Though fiscal 2002 revenues were down in all quarters compared to the prior year, revenues in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002 showed sequential growth over the immediately preceding quarters. Product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal 2001 and 2002. Product License Revenues Our product license revenues primarily consist of product license fees and license upgrade fees, both of which are related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis. Product license fees are all fees associated with a customers licensing of a given software product for the first time. License upgrade fees are all fees associated with a customers purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on a larger computer or computers. License upgrade fees are primarily generated by our mainframe products and include fees associated both with current and future additional processing capacity. In addition to product license fees and license upgrade fees, license revenues also include, to a lesser extent, term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a limited period of time. Our North American operations generated 66%, 54% and 56% of total license revenues in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. North American license revenues decreased 38% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 27% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. While license revenues were down across all product groups, the largest contributor to the revenue declines in both fiscal 2001 and 2002 was decreased capacity based license upgrade fees. International license revenues represented 34%, 46% and 44% of total license revenues in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. International license revenues increased 2% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and decreased 33% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2001 growth in Application & Database Performance Management license fees was partially offset by decreases in Enterprise Server Management license and upgrade fees. While license revenues were down across most product groups from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, decreased capacity based license upgrade fees were the largest contributor to the revenue decline for the year. 12 The international license revenue increase for fiscal 2001 and decline for fiscal 2002 both included a decrease of 2% due to foreign currency exchange rate changes during the periods, after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program. Maintenance, Enhancement and Support Revenues Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance, enhancement and support program. Maintenance, enhancement and support enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements, technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems, database management systems and applications. These fees are generally charged annually and have historically equaled 15% to 20% of the discounted price of the product. In addition, customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of 24x7 support at a standard rate of 20% of the discounted price of the associated product. In connection with this revision, we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products, whereas prior to this revision such periods were 90 days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products. Because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement, in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur. While this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time, there will be a negative short term revenue impact. In addition, there is a risk that our revenues could be negatively impacted if customers do not accept these changes to the maintenance program and choose to license competing products instead. Because this change was made late in the year, the impact on fiscal 2002 license and maintenance revenues was not significant. Maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run. Maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed; consequently, we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity. Due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity, the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for mainframe products. Historically, we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe based products. Should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products, increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues. To date, we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance, enhancement and support pricing model to the distributed systems market. Product Line Revenues PERCENTAGE CHANGE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 2002 COMPARED TO COMPARED TO 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 (IN MILLIONS) Enterprise Server Management ........................ $ 760.4 $ 598.5 $ 488.1 (21.3)% (18.4)% Business Integrated Scheduling ...................... 92.8 111.4 101.0 20.0% (9.3)% Application & Database Performance Management ....... 421.3 371.7 312.2 (11.8)% (16.0)% Recovery & Storage Management ....................... 308.9 256.6 218.2 (16.9)% (15.0)% Other software ...................................... 82.5 78.1 81.3 (5.3)% 4.1% Total license & maintenance revenues ........... $ 1,665.9 $ 1,416.3 $ 1,200.8 (15.0)% (15.2)% We market over 300 software solutions designed to improve the availability, performance and recoverability of enterprise applications, databases and other IT systems components operating in mainframe, distributed computing and Internet environments. These solutions fall into the five broad categories above. In managing our investment in these product categories we have considered each to be included in one of three strategic groups. The first group includes our Enterprise Server Management and Business Integrated Scheduling solutions. Our objective for this group has been to extend our core strengths in these markets. The second strategic group includes our Application & Database Performance Management and Recovery & Storage Management solutions. Our objective for this group has been to build our business in fast growing markets. The last group includes our other software products, such as our security, ERP, network management, output management and subscription services. The objective for this group has been to make strategic investments in what we anticipate will be sources of future growth. 13 Our Enterprise Server Management and Business Integrated Scheduling solutions combined represented 51%, 50% and 49% of total software revenues for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Total software revenues for this group declined 17% both from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. Because this group includes a high proportion of mainframe solutions, the external market factors discussed above were the primary cause of the revenue decline in fiscal 2001, more than offsetting the revenue growth for our Business Integrated Scheduling solutions. In fiscal 2002, license revenue decreases for both product groups due to the economic factors and the decline in capacity based license upgrade fees discussed above more than offset maintenance revenue increases. Our Application & Database Performance Management and Recovery & Storage Management solutions combined contributed 44% of total software revenues for each of fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Total software revenues for this group declined 14% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and 16% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. Though this group does not include a significant proportion of mainframe products, fiscal 2001 revenues for these solutions were negatively impacted by the reduction in enterprise license transactions as discussed above, because many of our mainframe customers are also customers of these products and sometimes purchase these products together with mainframe products in enterprise solutions. In fiscal 2002, license revenue decreases for both product groups due to the economic factors discussed above more than offset maintenance revenue increases. Our other software solutions contributed 5%, 6% and 7% of total software revenues for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Total software revenues for this group declined 5% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and grew 4% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2001, revenue decreases from our output management and ERP solutions more than offset growth from our security solutions and from our acquisitions of Evity in April 2000 and OptiSystems in August 2000. Fiscal 2002 growth includes increases in revenues from our ERP and security solutions, our subscription services and the network management solutions that were associated with our acquisition of Perform SA (Perform) in February 2001, which more than offset the license revenue decline for our output management solutions. Professional Services Revenues Professional services revenues, representing fees from implementation, integration and education services performed during the period, represented 3%, 6% and 7% of total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002. Professional services revenues increased 75% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 as we increased the related headcount to meet the increased demand for our service offerings during that period. The 6% decline in professional services revenues from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 related to our decreased license revenues, as this results in less demand for our implementation and integration services. Expenses PERCENTAGE CHANGE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 2002 COMPARED TO COMPARED TO 2000 2001 2002 2000 2001 (IN MILLIONS) Selling and marketing ............................ $ 559.7 $ 600.7 $ 538.8 7.3% (10.3)% Research and development ......................... 390.4 442.6 479.2 13.4% 8.3% Cost of professional services .................... 74.1 101.1 95.3 36.4% (5.7)% General and administrative ....................... 135.1 165.5 151.7 22.5% (8.3)% Acquired research and development ................ 80.8 21.4 (73.5)% (100.0)% Amortization and impairment of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles .......... 139.1 178.2 241.8 28.1% 35.7% Restructuring and severance costs ................ 52.9 n/a n/a Legal settlement ................................. 55.4 (100.0)% n/a Merger related costs and compensation charges .... 14.1 8.6 12.8 (39.0)% 48.8% Total operating expenses ................... $ 1,448.7 $ 1,518.1 $ 1,572.5 4.8% 3.6% Selling and Marketing Our selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, industry trade shows and sales seminars, and represented 33%, 40% and 42% of total revenues in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Personnel costs and sales commissions were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal 2001 and the expense decline in fiscal 2002. Selling and marketing year end headcount increased 5% from the end of fiscal 2000 to the end of fiscal 2001 and decreased 16% from the end of fiscal 2001 to the end of fiscal 2002. Sales commissions increased from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 even though fiscal 2001 license revenues declined, because of sales incentives implemented in the last half of the year. 14 The decline in commissions and other personnel costs from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 related to decreased license revenues and headcount reductions throughout the year. Selling and marketing expenses were further impacted in fiscal 2001 by the costs associated with our first global users conference and increased consulting fees for implementation of a customer relationship management system. In fiscal 2002, consulting fees and travel costs declined. Research and Development Research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include costs associated with the maintenance, enhancement and support of our products, computer hardware/software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center, royalties and the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization. Research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." We capitalize our software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by SFAS No. 86, and amortize these costs over the products estimated useful lives. During fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, we capitalized approximately $102.7 million, $112.2 million and $104.2 million, respectively, of software development and purchased software costs. We amortized $40.2 million, $60.2 million and $115.7 million in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, of capitalized software development and purchased software costs pursuant to SFAS No. 86, including $8.2 million, $16.5 million and $57.2 million, respectively, to accelerate the amortization of certain software products. We accelerated the amortization of these software products in each of these years as they were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets. As a result of the changes in market conditions and research and development headcount reductions during fiscal 2002, we have begun focusing more on our core and high potential growth businesses. As part of this effort, we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal 2002 and discontinued certain products throughout the portfolio. To the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products, we accelerated the amortization to write these balances off. This caused the increase in accelerated amortization from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. The increase in our research and development expenses for fiscal 2001 was primarily the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel, as well as associated benefits and facilities costs, and the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization. We increased our headcount in the research and development organization 11% from the end of fiscal 2000 to the end of fiscal 2001, including the addition of personnel from acquired companies. Research and development expenses increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 primarily due to the net effect of software capitalization and amortization, including the accelerated amortization discussed above, and a $5.0 million write off of prepaid royalties and other assets related to technology we no longer plan to utilize. These additional expenses more than offset reduced headcount costs, travel costs and consulting fees during the period. We reduced our research and development headcount by 14% from the end of fiscal 2001 to the end of fiscal 2002. Total capitalized software development costs, net of amortization, at March 31, 2002, were $211.8 million. Under SFAS No. 86, we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value as defined by SFAS No. 86 requires that we estimate future cash flows to be generated by the products and to use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual cash flows and amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant research and development expenses related to software asset write offs. During fiscal 2002, we also wrote off software assets totaling $14.9 million associated with certain business information integration products that were discontinued during the year as a result of the dissolution of that business unit as part of our restructuring plan. This charge is included in restructuring and severance costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2002 and is discussed further below under the heading " Restructuring and Severance Costs." 15 Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation, integration and education services that we perform for our customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. The increase in these costs from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 resulted from increased headcount to support the 75% growth in professional services revenues during that period. The decrease in these costs from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 is consistent with the 6% professional services revenue decline for the period and the resulting headcount reductions. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management, finance and accounting, facilities management and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services, consulting projects, insurance, costs of managing our foreign currency exposure and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings. The expense growth in fiscal 2001 primarily related to increased personnel costs, including $5.1 million of severance costs for management personnel who terminated their employment during the fourth quarter of that year. This severance amount included cash and restricted stock expense. The decline in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 was primarily related to decreased personnel costs, travel costs and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings. Fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew 13% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and declined 6% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. Acquired Research and Development In executing our product strategies, we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and, in the case of Boole, BGS and New Dimension, established software companies. We believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market, where we must compete with a variety of software vendors, and where our products must integrate with the predominant database management systems, operating systems, network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment. Accordingly, we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture. The acquired technology companies are often small, early stage software companies with minimal to no revenues, quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace. This strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans. The following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002. ACQUIRED ACQUIRED GOODWILL TOTAL TECHNOLOGY IPR&D AND OTHER PRICE (IN MILLIONS) Fiscal 2000: New Dimension ....................... $ 126.3 $ 80.8 $ 465.9 $ 673.0 $ 126.3 $ 80.8 $ 465.9 $ 673.0 Fiscal 2001: Evity ............................... $ 2.5 $ 7.0 $ 57.8 $ 67.3 OptiSystems ......................... 6.3 6.0 59.2 71.5 Various immaterial acquisitions ..... 14.5 3.7 18.2 36.4 $ 23.3 $ 16.7 $ 135.2 $ 175.2 Fiscal 2002: Various immaterial acquisitions ..... $ 10.5 $ $ 1.7 $ 12.2 $ 10.5 $ $ 1.7 $ 12.2 In April 1999, we acquired through a public tender offer in excess of 95% of the outstanding ordinary shares of New Dimension. Total consideration paid approximated $673.0 million, including the cost of the remaining 5% of outstanding shares acquired during fiscal 2000 and the historical cost of approximately $2.0 million for shares of New Dimension previously owned by Boole. We allocated $126.3 million to acquired technology, $435.9 million to goodwill and other intangibles and $30.0 million to equipment, receivables and other non software assets, net of liabilities assumed. We allocated $80.8 million, or 12% of the purchase price, to in process research and development (IPR&D), which represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility nor had an alternative future use. 16 At the acquisition date, New Dimension was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities in the following areas: o Integrated Operations Architecture(R) for the Enterprise, which was to be the supporting infrastructure for all of the distributed systems products from New Dimension. This project, as originally intended, was cancelled as we determined it was more appropriate to gradually extend the existing distributed systems infrastructure rather than replace it. o Expansion of the output management product family to include products for distributed systems. o E business enablement, the development of the infrastructure necessary to "Internet ize" the entire New Dimension product family. o Security, including additional features and add on applications for existing security applications. o Enhancements to the CONTROL M(R), CONTROL D(R), CONTROL SA(R) and Enterprise Controlstation(R) products. As of the date of the New Dimension acquisition, we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential use of the technology in different products, the stage of development and life cycle of each project, resale of the software and internal use. As such, the value of the purchased IPR&D was expensed at the time of the acquisition. As of March 31, 2002, the Integrated Operations Architecture for the Enterprise project has been cancelled and the remaining projects have been completed and the related products were made generally available. On April 25, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Evity in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The aggregate purchase price totaled $67.3 million, including cash consideration of $10.0 million, 1.0 million shares of common stock, 0.4 million common stock options and transaction costs, and was allocated as follows: $2.5 million to acquired technology, $57.8 million to goodwill and other intangibles and $7.0 million (10% of the purchase price) to purchased in process research and development. Net tangible assets acquired were insignificant. The amount allocated to purchased IPR&D represents the estimated fair value, based on risk adjusted cash flows, related to Evitys research and development projects not yet completed. At the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date, during the quarter ended June 30, 2000. At the acquisition date, Evity was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of SiteAngel 2.0, an enhanced version of Evitys SiteAngel website performance monitoring product, as well as new technologies in the areas of load testing and network infrastructure. The projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the web performance market. At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were approximately 45% complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress. Evity had incurred nearly $1.0 million on the in process projects and expected to spend approximately $1.3 million to complete all phases of the research and development. Anticipated completion dates ranged from 4 to 18 months, at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies. We completed SiteAngel 2.0 during fiscal 2001 and project costs were materially consistent with managements estimates at the acquisition date. Also during fiscal 2001, the remaining projects in process at the acquisition date were suspended indefinitely. On August 8, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of OptiSystems in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The aggregate purchase price totaled $71.5 million in cash, including transaction costs, and was allocated as follows: $6.3 million to acquired technology, $55.2 million to goodwill and other intangibles, $4.0 million to equipment, receivables and other non software assets, net of liabilities assumed, and $6.0 million (8% of the purchase price) to purchased in process research and development. The amount allocated to purchased IPR&D represents the estimated fair value, based on risk adjusted cash flows, related to OptiSystems incomplete research and development projects. At the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date, during the quarter ended September 30, 2000. At the acquisition date, OptiSystems was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several components of its Energizer(R) for R/3 product. The projects under development at the valuation date represent next generation technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands for the enterprise application performance market. 17 At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were approximately 50% complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress. OptiSystems had incurred approximately $1.0 million on the in process projects, and expected to spend approximately $1.2 million to complete all phases of the research and development. Anticipated completion dates ranged from 2 to 11 months, at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies. The projects have been completed and project costs were materially consistent with managements estimates at the acquisition date. We completed other immaterial acquisitions during fiscal 2001 and 2002 which were accounted for under the purchase method as indicated in the table above. In making our purchase price allocations, we considered present value calculations of income, analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items, assessments of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses, and income taxes from such projects. In the present value calculations, aggregate revenues for the New Dimension, Evity and OptiSystems developed, in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately 38%, 155% and 43%, respectively, for the four years, five years and five years following acquisition, respectively, assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs. The estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return. Due to the nature of the forecasts and risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects, discount rates of 20% to 30% were used to value the acquired IPR&D for the various acquisitions during fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002. Specifically, discount rates of 20%, 30% and 25% were used to value the acquired IPR&D for New Dimension, Evity and OptiSystems, respectively. Rates of 15%, 20% and 20% were used in discounting the cash flows associated with the respective developed technologies. These discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. We believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology. No assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods. The IPR&D charge for fiscal 2001 also includes the write off of assets totaling $4.7 million related to a technology agreement with Envive Corporation that was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Amortization and Impairment of Acquired Technology, Goodwill and Intangibles Under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions, portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill, workforce, customer base, software and other intangible assets. We are amortizing these intangibles over three to five year periods, which reflect the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The increase in amortization expense from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 is related to the Evity, OptiSystems and other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with various acquisitions. The assessment was performed because sustained negative economic conditions impacted our operations and expected future revenues. Current economic indicators suggest that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we recorded impairment charges of $15.5 million related to acquired technology to reflect these assets at their current estimated net realizable values and $47.8 million related to goodwill to reflect these assets at their current estimated fair values. These charges are reflected together with amortization expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2002, as amortization and impairment of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles. 18 We evaluated our acquired technology under the provisions of SFAS No. 86, our other intangibles under the provisions of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long lived Assets and of Long lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and our enterprise level goodwill under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." The impairment charges for acquired technology reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated net realizable values of the products. The net realizable values for acquired technology were estimated as the future gross revenues from the products reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the products, including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support required to satisfy our responsibilities set forth at the time of sale. The impairment charges for goodwill reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values of these assets. Fair value was determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows related to these assets. No impairment was identified for our other intangible assets. Impairment charges by asset category were as follows: TOTAL ACQUIRED IMPAIRMENT TECHNOLOGY GOODWILL CHARGE (IN MILLIONS) Acquisition: New Dimension ....................... $ 8.4 $ $ 8.4 Evity ............................... 0.8 21.6 22.4 OptiSystems ......................... 2.0 20.2 22.2 Perform ............................. 4.3 6.0 10.3 Total ........................... $ 15.5 $ 47.8 $ 63.3 As of March 31, 2002, acquired technology of $50.2 million and goodwill and intangibles of $133.6 million remained. As of April 1, 2002, we will adopt SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under this pronouncement, goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value. Acquired technology will continue to be amortized under SFAS No. 86. Goodwill and intangibles of $124.9 million will remain at April 1, 2002, that will no longer be amortized. Intangible assets of $8.7 million with finite lives will continue to be amortized over those useful lives. We review the realizability of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis, and when there is an indication of impairment, we perform the procedures under the applicable accounting pronouncements to quantify any impairment that exists. Determining the amount of impairment of these assets, if any, requires that we estimate future cash flows and make judgments regarding discount rates and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of those assets, as applicable. Actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from our estimates. Future impairment charges under existing pronouncements and under SFAS No. 142 to be adopted April 1, 2002, could be material. Restructuring and Severance Costs During fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions. This plan included the involuntary termination of 1,260 employees during the year. These actions were across all divisions and geographies and the affected employees received cash severance packages. During fiscal 2002, we also discontinued certain business information integration products as a result of the dissolution of that business unit, and announced the closure of certain locations throughout the world. A charge of $52.9 million was recorded during fiscal 2002 for employee severance, the write off of software assets related to discontinued products, net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the related technology, and office closures. During fiscal 2002, we sold our enterprise data propagation (EDP) technology for a minority equity investment in the purchaser and future cash payments to be made based on the purchasers quarterly sales to our former EDP customers over the next four years. As these products were part of the discontinued business information integration products, the proceeds will be recorded as a reduction of restructuring and severance costs, as a recovery of the amount previously written off for these products. For fiscal 2002, proceeds of $0.2 million were recorded, reflecting the estimated fair value of the equity investment received. As the future cash payments, if any, cannot be currently estimated, they will be recorded in the periods received as a reduction of restructuring and severance costs up to the amount previously written off. Any receipts in excess of the related asset write off will be reflected as other income. 19 As of March 31, 2002, $2.6 million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the restructuring plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows: BALANCE AT PAID OUT OR BALANCE AT MARCH 31, CHARGED TO CHARGED AGAINST MARCH 31, 2001 EXPENSE RELATED ASSETS 2002 (IN MILLIONS) Severance and related expenses ............................. $ $ 35.1 $ (33.8) $ 1.3 Write off of software assets, net of proceeds received ..... 14.7 (14.7) Facilities costs ........................................... 3.1 (1.8) 1.3 Total accrual .................................... $ $ 52.9 $ (50.3) $ 2.6 Legal Settlement In October 1999, we settled all claims in a lawsuit styled BMC Software, Inc., plaintiff, vs. Peregrine/Bridge Transfer Corp., Skunkware, Inc., Neon Systems, Inc., Peregrine Systems, Inc., Wayne E. Fisher and John J. Moores, defendants, vs. BMC Software, Inc. and Max P. Watson, counter defendants. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. Merger Related Costs and Compensation Charges In conjunction with our merger with Boole in March 1999, management approved a formal plan of restructuring which included steps to be taken to integrate the operations of the two companies, consolidate duplicate facilities and streamline operations to achieve reductions in overhead expenses in future periods. During fiscal 2000, $14.1 million was incurred related to the plan, primarily for termination benefits. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, $2.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of previously accrued merger costs were reversed, as certain lease and severance obligations were satisfied at amounts below the amounts originally estimated. These reversals are reflected as a reduction of merger related costs and compensation charges in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2001 and 2002. As of March 31, 2002, we have minimal facilities costs that remain accrued. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, we recorded merger related compensation charges of $11.4 million and $13.2 million, respectively. These compensation charges are primarily related to the vesting of common stock issued as part of the Evity acquisition to certain Evity employee shareholders who we employed after the acquisition. The vesting of the Evity related common stock will be complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Other Income, net Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, realized gains and losses on marketable and other investment securities, and interest expense on short term borrowings. Other income, net increased 68% from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and decreased 23% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002. Other income for fiscal 2001 includes a $2.9 million one time gain related to the sale of a financial instrument and a one time $6.3 million gain related to a real estate transaction. The remaining increases in other income, net for fiscal 2001 are primarily due to decreased interest expense on short term borrowings. In fiscal 2002, the decrease in other income, net primarily relates to the one time gains in the prior year discussed above, a $6.4 million loss on a marketable security and $4.6 million of impairment charges related to other equity investments. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of our payment of all short term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $68.9 million and $18.0 million in fiscal 2000 and 2001, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $46.4 million in fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rates were 22%, 30% and 20% for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. During fiscal 2000, the decreased effective income tax rate is the result of lower taxes associated with our European operations and the effect of tax exempt interest on certain investments. The effective tax rates for fiscal 2001 and 2002 are primarily impacted by acquisition related charges during those years that are not deductible for tax purposes. For an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 20 Recording income tax benefits results in the recognition of tax assets representing current tax refunds receivable from net operating loss carrybacks and or the future benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations. We evaluate the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards at each balance sheet date to determine their realizability, considering currently enacted tax laws. If we determine that the assets are not fully realizable, a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the asset balances to their realizable values through a charge to income tax expense. Determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations. Actual taxable income could differ from our estimates. As of March 31, 2002, we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and therefore no valuation allowance is recorded related to this asset. If we conclude that this tax asset requires a valuation allowance in the future, the effect on income tax expense could be material. As of March 31, 2002, we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to tax credit carryforwards will not be realized and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance for this amount. If we conclude that this tax asset requires an additional valuation allowance in the future, the effect on income tax expense could be material. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. Earnings per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share was $1.01, $0.17 and $(0.75) in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was $0.96, $0.17 and $(0.75), respectively. The changes in earnings per share over the three years primarily resulted from the factors discussed above. Weighted average shares outstanding did not fluctuate significantly between these periods. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The Statement applies to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting at the point of acquisition for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets, other than those acquired in a business combination, and the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under this Statement, all goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those useful lives. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, except that goodwill and intangibles that arise from business combinations after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As such, we will adopt the Statement in its entirety on April 1, 2002. Adoption of this Statement will eliminate a portion of the amortization expense from our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), which for fiscal 2002 totaled $130.0 million. Goodwill and intangibles of $124.9 million will remain at April 1, 2002, that will no longer be amortized. We are in the process of determining the impairment charge, if any, that will be required upon adoption of this Statement. If such a charge is required, it will be reflected as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the quarter ending June 30, 2002. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," and SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 143 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the obligation is incurred, the liability must be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Upon initial recognition of such a liability, an equal amount must be capitalized into the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and subsequently expensed over its useful life. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 for the disposal of a segment of a business. This statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework in SFAS No. 121, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related to Statement 121. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We believe that adoption of SFAS No. 143 and SFAS No. 144 will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 21 Quarterly Results The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. This information has been prepared on the same basis as the Consolidated Financial Statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. Our quarterly results are subject to seasonality and can be volatile and difficult to predict accurately prior to a quarters end as discussed under "Certain Risks and Uncertainties." Historical quarterly financial results and trends may not be indicative of future results. QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, SEPT. 30, DEC. 31, MAR. 31, JUNE 30, SEPT. 30, DEC. 31, MAR. 31, 2000 2000 2000 2001 2001 2001 2001 2002 (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) Total revenues ............................. $ 373.8 $ 324.3 $ 387.0 $ 424.5 $ 341.0 $ 295.1 $ 321.0 $ 331.8 Selling and marketing expenses ............. 152.2 132.8 154.4 161.3 152.8 132.9 128.4 124.7 Research and development expenses .......... 106.6 110.2 111.2 114.6 113.0 105.8 137.2 123.2 Cost of professional services .............. 21.7 24.8 25.5 29.1 26.9 25.1 22.7 20.6 General and administrative expenses ........ 38.3 38.2 36.4 52.6 41.9 40.2 36.1 33.5 Acquired research and development .......... 11.7 6.0 0.4 3.3 Amortization and impairment of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles ..... 39.6 44.8 46.7 47.1 48.2 48.5 103.9 41.2 Restructuring and severance costs .......... 12.0 32.7 8.2 Merger related costs and compensation charges .................................. 2.1 3.3 2.4 0.8 2.7 3.1 5.8 1.2 Operating income (loss) .................... 1.6 (35.8) 10.0 15.7 (56.5) (93.2) (121.3) (12.6) Net earnings (loss) ........................ $ 10.0 $ (12.5) $ 21.9 $ 23.0 $ (34.5) $ (53.3) $ (94.5) $ (1.8) Basic EPS .................................. $ 0.04 $ (0.05) $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ (0.14) $ (0.22) $ (0.39) $ (0.01) Diluted EPS ................................ $ 0.04 $ (0.05) $ 0.09 $ 0.09 $ (0.14) $ (0.22) $ (0.39) $ (0.01) Shares used in computing basic EPS ......... 245.5 246.1 244.7 245.5 247.3 246.5 243.6 242.1 Shares used in computing diluted EPS ....... 254.4 246.1 249.3 251.6 247.3 246.5 243.6 242.1 Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2002, our cash and cash equivalents were $330.0 million and our marketable securities were $773.7 million, for a total of $1,103.7 million, an increase of $99.7 million from the March 31, 2001 total. Our working capital as of March 31, 2002, was $316.2 million, reflecting an increase from the March 31, 2001 balance of $73.7 million due primarily to positive operating cash flow. Stockholders equity as of March 31, 2002, was $1.5 billion. We continue to invest a portion of our cash in securities with maturities beyond one year. While typically yielding greater returns, this reduces reported working capital. Our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and are highly liquid. The majority of our marketable securities are classified as held to maturity under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." As such, they are recorded at amortized cost and changes in their fair values during the holding period are not reflected in the financial statements. If the creditworthiness of an issuer of these securities deteriorates, losses would be recorded when we determine the decline in fair value is other than temporary, when we sell the securities or upon default by the issuer. The remainder of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Changes in the fair values of these securities are reflected as unrealized gains and losses in stockholders equity and as a component of comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on these securities are reflected in earnings either when realized through our sale of the securities or when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining whether a value decline is other than temporary requires that we make judgments about expected future events. Actual future fair values could differ from our expectations. We continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations. For the year ended March 31, 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $522.8 million. Our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses, software maintenance and professional services. We provide financing on a portion of these sales transactions, to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. We participate in established programs with third party financing institutions to securitize or sell a significant portion of our finance receivables. We utilize certain wholly owned, fully consolidated special purpose entities in these transfers. In addition, we securitize finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two special purpose entities sponsored by third party financial institutions. The entities sponsored by third party financial institutions are 22 multi seller conduits with access to commercial paper markets, that purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership in either of the third party financial institution sponsored entities and have no voting influence over either of these entities operating and financial decisions. As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. When we sell receivables in securitizations of software installment contracts, we retain a beneficial interest in the securitized receivables, which is subordinate to the interests of the entities sponsored by the third party financial institutions. The subordinate interests are measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using our best estimates of the key assumptions, including expected credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. We periodically review the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the retained interest. The financing institutions have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. Our retained interests are subordinate to the investors interests and the value of the retained interests is subject to credit and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets. At March 31, 2001 and 2002, our retained interests were $25.0 million and $14.9 million, respectively. Other finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financing institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During the year ended March 31, 2002, we transferred $263.0 million of such receivables through these programs. The high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis without a negative cash flow impact. Net cash used in investing activities in the year ended March 31, 2002 was $48.6 million, primarily related to capitalized software development costs and disbursements for the purchase of marketable securities which were partially offset by receipts from the maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended March 31, 2002 was $283.8 million, which derived primarily from the repayment of all short term borrowings and treasury stock purchases. On April 24, 2000, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500.0 million in common stock. During the year ended March 31, 2002, we purchased 9.0 million shares for $155.1 million. From the inception of the repurchase plan through March, 2002, we have purchased 16.2 million shares for $310.2 million. We plan to continue to buy stock on the open market from time to time, depending on market conditions, cash flows and other possible uses of our cash. We have no short term or long term debt outstanding. Our obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are $65.7 million in fiscal 2003, $58.7 million in fiscal 2004, $48.6 million in fiscal 2005, $40.9 million in fiscal 2006, $36.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $66.5 million in fiscal 2008 and beyond. We believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Our Stock Price is Volatile. Our stock price has been and is highly volatile. Our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of future revenue and earnings growth rates. Any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price. Our historical financial results should not be seen as indicative of future results. The Timing and Size of License Contracts Could Cause Our Quarterly Revenues and Earnings to Fluctuate. Our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially quarter to quarter. The timing and amount of our license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain. We generally operate with little or no sales backlog and, as a result, license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter. A significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter, and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expectations until the final days or day of a quarter. 23 We have a High Degree of Operating Leverage. Our business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage. A substantial portion of our operating costs and expenses consists of employee and facility related costs, which are relatively fixed over the short term. In addition, our expense levels and hiring plans are based substantially on our projections of future revenues. If near term demand weakens in a given quarter, there would likely be a material adverse effect on operating results and a resultant drop in our stock price. We May Have Difficulty Achieving our EPS Goal. There is a risk that we may not be able to achieve our earnings per share goal in the near term. If current weak global economic conditions continue or if there is continued global economic uncertainty due to terrorism or wartime conditions, we may find it difficult to sustain our revenues or achieve revenue growth. Although we have taken steps to reduce our expenses in light of current conditions, our ability to achieve our earnings per share goal for fiscal 2003 is dependent upon increasing revenues year over year. If we are unable to achieve our earnings per share goal, our stock price may be adversely affected. Decreasing Demand for Enterprise License Transactions Could Adversely Affect Revenues. Fees from enterprise license transactions have historically been a fundamental component of our revenues. These revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their computer processing capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater processing capacity in future periods. Prior to 2000, we licensed many of our larger customers to operate our mainframe products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current mainframe processing capacity. During the past several years, we also entered into many enterprise license agreements with our larger customers to operate our distributed systems products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current distributed processing capacity. In a weak economy, these customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us. If economic conditions weaken further, demand for data processing capacity could continue to slow or even decline. In addition, the uncertain economic environment has reduced customers expectations of future capacity growth, thus lessening demand for licensing excess processing capacity in anticipation of future growth. If our customers who have entered into multi year capacity based licenses for excess processing capacity do not increase their processing capacity beyond the levels previously licensed from us or license additional processing capacity in anticipation of future growth, then our license revenues may not grow and our earnings could be adversely affected. Increased Competition and Pricing Pressures Could Adversely Affect Our Earnings. The market for systems management software has been increasingly competitive for the past number of years. We compete with a variety of software vendors including IBM and Computer Associates. We derived over half of our total revenues in fiscal 2002 from software products for IBM and IBM compatible mainframe computers. IBM continues, directly and through third parties, to enhance and market its utilities for IMS and DB2 as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors. Although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions, IBM has begun to invest more heavily in the IMS and DB2 utility market and appears to be committed to competing in these markets. If IBM is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our IMS, DB2 and other products at a lower cost, our business may be materially adversely affected. CA is also competing with us in these markets. Competition has led to increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets. We continue to reduce the cost to our customers of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to such competitive pressures. Microsoft entered the distributed systems monitoring and management market through its relationship with NetIQ and is now competing with us in the market for management tools for the Windows environment. In connection with the introduction of its zSeries mainframe server in the fourth quarter of 2000, IBM has announced changes to its mainframe software pricing, including a new workload based pricing model offering. We have also announced that we will support the new workload based pricing structure for the zSeries mainframe server, but the software used to measure workloads is not yet available. As such, the effect of this change on our future mainframe license revenues cannot be determined. 24 Our Products Must Remain Compatible with Ever changing Operating and Database Environments. IBM, HP, Sun, Microsoft and Oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and, in many cases, are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, database systems, systems software and computer hardware. Such new products could in the future incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. Although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Future Product Development is Dependent Upon Access to Third party Source Code. In the past, licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with "source code," which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers, and "object code," which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation. Since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software, which must interface with the operating systems, independent software vendors such as us were able to develop and market compatible software. IBM and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems. To date, this policy has not had a material effect on us. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Future Product Development is Dependent Upon Early Access to Third party Operating and Database Systems. Operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available (GA) versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to assure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Failure to Adapt to Technological Change Could Adversely Affect Our Earnings. If we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry, such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. During the past several years, many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace. The distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets. Our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors, including the success of our existing distributed systems products, the timely introduction and success of future software products, and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products. We have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past, particularly with some of our distributed systems products, and expect to have delays in the future. Delays in new mainframe or distributed systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. New products or new versions of existing products may, despite testing, contain undetected errors or bugs that could delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products. 25 Maintenance Revenue Growth Could Slow. Maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run. Maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases; consequently, we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity. Due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity, the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products. In addition, customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement. Should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products, increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues. Also, renewal rates for maintenance on our distributed systems products are lower than on our mainframe products. Changes in Pricing Practices Could Adversely Affect Revenues and Earnings. We may choose in fiscal 2003 or a future fiscal year to make changes to our product packaging, pricing or licensing programs. If made, such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of 24x7 support at a standard rate of 20% of the discounted price of the associated product. In connection with this revision, we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products, whereas prior to this revision such periods were 90 days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products. Because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement, in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur. While this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time, there will be a negative short term revenue impact, which we have considered in determining our estimates of future revenues. In addition, there is a risk that our revenues could be negatively impacted if customers do not accept these changes to the maintenance program and choose to license competing products instead. Our Customers May Not Accept our Product Strategies. Historically, we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications. We are now integrating multiple software products and offering packaged solutions for customers systems. There can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions. In addition, there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions. Risks Related to Business Combinations. As part of our overall strategy, we have acquired or invested in, and plan to continue to acquire or invest in, complementary companies, products, and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include: the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies; the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business; the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel; the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses; and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable, especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits. 26 With each of our acquisitions, we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures, employees, systems and products of these companies. Retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement, development, support, sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products. We have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical, sales and marketing employees; nonetheless, we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future. Enforcement of Our Intellectual Property Rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Possibility of Infringement Claims. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights. We expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlap. In addition, we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents, especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years. Regardless of its merit, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to International Operations. We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, substantial resources and funding to build our international service and support infrastructure. Operating costs in many countries, including many of those in which we operate, are higher than in the United States. In order to increase international sales in fiscal 2003 and subsequent periods, we must continue to globalize our software product lines; expand existing and establish additional foreign operations; hire additional personnel; identify suitable locations for sales, marketing, customer service and development; and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories. Future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices, particularly our European operations. Our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Generally, our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies. If these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly, we could have significant gains or losses. Many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally. We maintain a software development office in India which operates as an extension of our primary development offices and we contract with third party developers in India. To date, hostilities between India and Pakistan in the disputed region of Kashmir have not adversely affected our operations in India. Should we be unable to conduct operations in India in the future, we believe that our business would not be materially adversely affected. Conditions in Israel. Our scheduling, security, output management and ERP development operations are conducted primarily in Israel and, accordingly, we are directly affected by economic, political and military conditions in Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a state of hostility has existed, varying in degree and intensity, between Israel and the Palestinian people and the Arab countries. In addition, Israel and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the Arab countries since Israels establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict 27 whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. We maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans, and to date, the current conflict in the region and hostilities within Israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in Israel. In addition, certain of our Israeli employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time. Although our businesses located in Israel have historically operated effectively under these requirements, we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on our operations in the future. Possible Adverse Impact Of Interpretations of Existing Accounting Pronouncements. On April 1, 1998 and 1999 we adopted AICPA SOP 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition," and SOP 98 9 "Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions," respectively. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Based on our reading and interpretation of these SOPs, we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. However, the AICPA and its Software Revenue Recognition Task Force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Also, the SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the SEC. Future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non U.S. enterprises is the local currency. For fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, approximately 36%, 43% and 42% of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of North America, substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies. Similarly, substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies. As a result, our U.S. dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk: forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used to reduce currency exposure associated with our rights and obligations denominated in foreign currencies that subject us to transaction risk. The terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month. Forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts, with terms generally less than one year, are used to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, sales transactions. Principal currencies hedged are the Euro and British pound, in Europe, the Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the Asia Pacific region and the Israeli shekel. While we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal 2000, 2001 or 2002. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2002, and our financial position, results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2002, we estimate that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on our future results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the instruments. We used a value at risk ("VAR") model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. 28 Interest Rate Risk Investments We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated $1.1 billion at March 31, 2002, and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. Based on our financial position, results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2002, we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the investments. We used a VAR model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
