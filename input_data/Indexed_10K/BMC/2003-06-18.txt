ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION INTRODUCTION This section includes historical information, certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading "Certain Risks and Uncertainties" about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others. It is important that the business discussion in Item 1 of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties, and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, in process research and development of acquired businesses, acquired technology, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and marketable securities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses, the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. The critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments listed above are discussed further throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. HISTORICAL INFORMATION Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income (loss) or net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating margins, see the discussions below under the heading "Certain Risks and Uncertainties." 8 ACQUISITIONS In April 2000, we acquired Evity for 1.6 million shares of common stock and cash of $10.0 million. Stock options to purchase 0.4 million common shares were issued to replace outstanding Evity stock options. In August 2000, we acquired OptiSystems for cash of $70.2 million. In November 2002, we acquired the assets of Remedy from Peregrine Systems, Inc. (Peregrine) for cash of $355.0 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of Remedy. In accordance with the purchase agreement, the cash purchase price was adjusted to $347.3 million subsequent to March 31, 2003. In March 2003, we acquired IT Masters for cash of $42.5 million. These transactions, along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions, were accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the percentages that selected items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) bear to total revenues.

We generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products, support and services are sold to our customers. We recognize revenue in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition" and SOP 98 9, "Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions." These statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions. In applying these statements, we recognize software license fees upon meeting the following four criteria: execution of the signed contract, delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer, determination that the software license fees are fixed or determinable, and determination that collection of the software license fees is probable. In instances when any one of the four criteria is not met, we will either defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met or will recognize the software license revenue on a ratable basis, as required by SOPs 97 2 and 98 9. Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis. Revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment. We have an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. Further, the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity. Revenues from sales through agents, 9 distributors and resellers are recorded either at the gross amount charged the customer or net of commissions payable, based on the economic risks and ongoing product support responsibilities we assume. On occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations from customers at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these customers. License revenues from such transactions represent less than one percent of our total license revenues in any period. Revenues from professional services are typically recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts, or on a percentage of completion basis. Our professional services revenues also include sales of third party software products which typically support our product lines. These revenues are recorded net of amounts payable to the third party software vendors. When several elements, including software licenses, maintenance, enhancement and support and professional services, are sold to a customer through a single contract, the revenues from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based upon the residual method, whereby the fair value of the undelivered elements of the contract is deferred. We have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance, enhancement and support and professional services. Accordingly, software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance, enhancement and support and or professional services, and where the maintenance, enhancement and support and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software. In those instances where professional services are essential to the functionality of the software, contract accounting is applied to both the software license and services elements of the arrangement. In the event a contract contains terms which are inconsistent with our vendor specific objective evidence, all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis. Based on our interpretation of SOP 97 2 and SOP 98 9, we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. Future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. PERCENTAGE CHANGE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2002 2003 COMPARED TO COMPARED TO 2001 2002 2003 2001 2002 (IN MILLIONS) License: North America .................... $ 483.5 $ 351.4 $ 325.8 (27.3)% (7.3)% International .................... 408.7 273.6 279.9 (33.1)% 2.3% Total license revenues ........ 892.2 625.0 605.7 (29.9)% (3.1)% Maintenance: North America .................... 330.8 355.2 385.7 7.4% 8.6% International .................... 193.3 220.6 250.1 14.1% 13.4% Total maintenance revenues .... 524.1 575.8 635.8 9.9% 10.4% Professional services: North America .................... 53.2 45.8 37.5 (13.9)% (18.1)% International .................... 40.1 42.3 47.7 5.5% 12.8% Total professional services revenues .................... 93.3 88.1 85.2 (5.6)% (3.3)% Total revenues ................ $1,509.6 $1,288.9 $1,326.7 (14.6)% 2.9% Total revenues declined 15% in fiscal 2002. Continued absorption of prepaid capacity and difficult economic conditions in domestic and international markets throughout fiscal 2002 resulted in reduced information technology spending by many of our customers. Though the number of license transactions declined only 4% during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, tighter budgets and higher required approval levels caused many customers to enter into smaller transactions in terms of dollar value. Difficult economic conditions have persisted and information technology spending remains depressed. We have experienced a decline in the size of transactions with our largest customers, which historically have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we acquired Remedy in November 2002. Excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, total revenues declined 3% in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the economic conditions described above and reduced revenues for our PATROL solutions during the first half of fiscal 2003, as discussed below under Product Line Revenues. License revenue deferrals for fiscal 2003 were consistent with fiscal 2002 and therefore did not have an impact on the revenue change from year to year. Including Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, total revenues increased 3%. Product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal 2002 and 2003. 10 PRODUCT LICENSE REVENUES Our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis. Product license fees can be associated with a customers licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customers purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or by additional users. In addition to perpetual based product license fees, our product license revenues also include, to a lesser extent, term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time. For the year ended March 31, 2003, gross additions to deferred license revenue were $134.6 million. Based on licensing trends and increased customer requests for contractual terms that result in deferral of revenue, we expect that our base of deferred license revenue will continue to grow in the near future. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. During these negotiations, the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral may be requested by a customer, while in some cases we may suggest inclusion of these terms and conditions where it makes business sense to do so. In either case, the resulting contract must be acceptable to both parties. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, the Company recognizes such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is predictable, and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred balance. As of March 31, 2002 and 2003, our total deferred license revenue balance was $168.9 million and $218.1 million, respectively. Our North American operations generated 54%, 56% and 54% of total license revenues in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. North American license revenues decreased 27% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 7% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, North American license revenues declined 13% in fiscal 2003. While license revenues were down across most product groups in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, the largest contributor to the revenue declines in both years was decreased license revenues for our mainframe data management products. In fiscal 2003, decreased PATROL license revenues also had a significant impact. International license revenues represented 46%, 44% and 46% of total license revenues in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. International license revenues decreased 33% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and increased 2% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. While license revenues were down across most product groups from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, decreased license revenues for our mainframe data management products were the largest contributor to the revenue decline for the year. Excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, international license revenues declined 4% in fiscal 2003. Increases in license revenue for our mainframe data management and MAINVIEW products were more than offset by declines for our PATROL, distributed systems data management and scheduling and output management products. The international license revenue decline for fiscal 2002 included a decrease of 2% and the decline in fiscal 2003 was net of an increase of 6% due to foreign currency exchange rate changes during the periods, after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program. MAINTENANCE, ENHANCEMENT AND SUPPORT REVENUES Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance, enhancement and support program. Maintenance, enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements, technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems, database management systems, networks, storage systems and applications. Excluding Remedy, these fees are generally charged annually and such fees have equaled 15% to 20% of the discounted price of the product prior to the program change in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 discussed below, and have equaled 20% subsequent to the program change. In addition, customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement. Maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement. Remedys maintenance fees are generally charged annually and equal 15% to 22% of the list price of the product. In addition, customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages on Remedy products for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees. 11 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of 24x7 support at a standard rate of 20% of the discounted price of the associated product. In connection with this revision, we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products, whereas prior to this revision such periods were 90 days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products. Because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement, in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur. While this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time, there has been a negative short term revenue impact. As discussed above, this maintenance program does not apply to Remedy products. Maintenance revenues increased 10% in both fiscal 2002 and 2003 primarily as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run and the additional maintenance revenue associated with Remedy. Excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, maintenance revenues increased 5% in fiscal 2003. Maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed; consequently, we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity. Due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity, the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements. These discounts, combined with the reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts discussed above and the recent decline in our license revenues, have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue excluding Remedy. Further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting could lead to declines in our maintenance revenues excluding Remedy. Historically, our maintenance renewal rates have been high, but economic pressures could cause customers to reduce their licensed capacity and therefore the capacity upon which our maintenance, enhancement and support fees are charged. We expect Remedy maintenance revenues to increase over the next fiscal year. As required by purchase accounting for the acquisition, the Remedy deferred maintenance revenue at the acquisition date was written down to fair value, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As such, the amounts recognized as maintenance revenue out of that acquisition date deferred revenue balance will reflect this write down. The vast majority of the acquisition date deferred revenue will be recognized during the 12 months following the acquisition. All maintenance fees generated subsequent to the acquisition date will be deferred and recognized over the maintenance period at full contractual amounts.

Our recent acquisition of Remedy extends our solutions to include products that automate service related business processes through a complete suite of service management applications. In fiscal 2003, our solutions were broadly divided into three core business units and a fourth business unit geared towards solution areas in markets that appear to offer high growth opportunities. The Enterprise Data 12 Management group includes products designed for managing database management systems on mainframe and distributed computing platforms. The Enterprise Systems Management group includes our systems management and monitoring, scheduling and output management solutions. The Remedy group includes our service management solutions. The High Potential product lines encompass storage management, security management, enterprise applications management, subscription services and Linux management. We evaluate our investments in these product lines on an ongoing basis and increase or decrease such investments as necessary, based on our expectations of the products future growth. Our Enterprise Data Management solutions combined represented 53%, 48% and 45% of total software revenues for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total software revenues for this group declined 23% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 4% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Because this product group includes a high proportion of mainframe solutions, the continued absorption of prepaid capacity and the external market factors discussed above were the primary cause of the decline in license revenues in fiscal 2002, more than offsetting an increase in maintenance revenue for that year. In fiscal 2003, the economic conditions discussed above caused both license and maintenance revenues for our mainframe data management products to decline, more than offsetting an increase in maintenance revenue for our distributed systems data management products. The maintenance revenue decline was primarily a result of lower discounted prices and slowing capacity growth, which was not sufficient to offset these reduced prices. Our Enterprise Systems Management solutions combined contributed 41%, 44% and 42% of total software revenues for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total software revenues for this group declined 9% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 1% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, license revenue decreases for this product group, due to the economic factors discussed above, more than offset maintenance revenue increases. License revenues decreased in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the continued weakness in IT spending and a reduction in Unix shipments from hardware manufacturers. These external factors, coupled with delays in customer purchase decisions resulting from delays in our release of significant enhancements to components of the PATROL product line during the first half of the year, had a direct negative impact on PATROL license revenues, more than offsetting license revenue increases for the MAINVIEW and Scheduling & Output Management product lines and maintenance revenue increases for the PATROL and Scheduling & Output Management solutions. The remaining key PATROL enhancements were delivered at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Though PATROL license revenues were down for the second half of the year compared to the same period in fiscal 2002, such revenues for the third and fourth quarters increased sequentially over the immediately preceding quarters. These increases were due, in part, to sales from the newly introduced agentless monitoring product, PATROL Express(R). Our High Potential product lines contributed 5%, 7% and 7% of total software revenues for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total software revenues for this group increased 16% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 3% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 growth includes revenue increases across all product lines. However, license revenue for our High Potential products declined in fiscal 2003. We evaluate our investments in these product lines on an ongoing basis and will increase or decrease such investments as necessary, based on our expectations of the products future growth. As of April 1, 2003, we have decided from an organizational perspective to eliminate the High Potential product lines as standalone units and to combine the storage management, enterprise application management, subscription services and Linux management product lines into the core Enterprise Systems Management business unit. The security product group will continue to operate as an independent business unit and currently has a dedicated sales force in North America. We have also made changes related to the storage management product line, from a go to market perspective. Our mainframe storage management and storage device knowledge modules remain key components of our systems management solutions; however, we have decided to limit our future research and development investment in one product, PATROL Storage Manager, to supporting the existing version of this product. This decision is based on our focus on improving profit margins and allocating resources to more attractive opportunities. Revenues from our Remedy products for the period from the acquisition date of November 20, 2002 through March 31, 2003, contributed 6% of total software revenues for fiscal 2003, including 13% of total software revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter, its first full quarter of results after the acquisition, including the impact of the write down of the acquisition date deferred maintenance revenue discussed above. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUES Professional services revenues, representing fees from implementation, integration and education services performed during the periods and sales of third party software products, represented 6%, 7% and 6% of total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. Professional services revenues declined 6% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 3% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date, professional services revenues declined 7%. The declines in both years are the result of our decreased license revenues, as this results in less demand for our implementation and integration services. Our professional services headcount has decreased due to the lower license revenue levels. 13 EXPENSES Beginning in fiscal 2002, we increased our focus on expense control to better align our cost structure with the realities of a more difficult revenue environment. This initiative included headcount reductions across all divisions and geographies, office consolidations, elimination of certain product lines and reductions in discretionary spending on items such as travel, consulting fees and equipment. We were able to reduce these costs significantly while maintaining our industry leading product quality, customer support and sales relationships. This initiative has continued throughout fiscal 2003 and will continue into the future, as necessary.

Selling and marketing expenses decreased 10% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 7% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date, selling and marketing expenses declined 12%. Personnel costs were the largest contributor to the expense declines in fiscal 2002 and 2003 as a result of headcount reductions during those years. Consulting fees and travel costs also declined in fiscal 2002 and advertising, marketing and travel costs decreased in fiscal 2003. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT Research, development and support expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include costs associated with the maintenance, enhancement and support of our products, computer hardware/software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center, royalties and the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization. Research, development and support costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." We capitalize our software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by SFAS No. 86, and amortize these costs over the products estimated economic lives, which historically have been five years. As discussed below, we revised the estimated economic lives for certain of our software products as of January 1, 2003, such that the capitalized costs for the majority of our products will be amortized over an estimated life of three years. Total capitalized software development costs, net of amortization, at March 31, 2003, were $192.7 million. Under SFAS No. 86, we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value as defined by SFAS No. 86 requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant research, development and support expenses related to software asset write offs. 14 The following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and amortized during fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. Amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets. YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 2002 2003 (IN MILLIONS) Software development and purchased software costs capitalized ........................................ $(112.2) $(104.2) $ (88.2) Total amortization .................................... 60.2 115.7 107.6 Net increase (decrease) in research, development and support expenses ............................... $ (52.0) $ 11.5 $ 19.4 Accelerated amortization included in total amortization above ................................. $ 16.5 $ 57.2 $ 47.4 As a result of the changes in market conditions and research and development headcount reductions during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, we focused more on our core and high potential growth businesses. As part of this effort, we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 and discontinued certain products. To the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products, we accelerated the amortization to write these balances off. This was the primary reason for the increase in accelerated amortization in fiscal 2002 and 2003 as compared to fiscal 2001. The continued need to accelerate amortization to maintain our capitalized software costs at net realizable value, the results of the valuation performed for the Remedy acquisition that indicated a three year life was appropriate for that acquired technology and changes in the average life cycles for certain of our software products caused us to evaluate the estimated economic lives for our internally developed software products. As a result of this evaluation, we revised the estimated economic lives of certain products as of January 1, 2003, such that most products will be amortized over an estimated life of three years. These changes in estimated economic lives resulted in an additional $12.4 million of amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2003 by $0.03 per share. Research, development and support expenses increased 8% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 primarily due to the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization, including the accelerated amortization discussed above, and a $5.0 million write off of prepaid royalties and other assets related to technology we no longer plan to utilize. These additional expenses more than offset reduced headcount costs, travel costs and consulting fees during the period. Research, development and support expenses increased 2% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date, research, development and support expenses decreased 2% primarily as a result of reductions in personnel, professional fees and royalty costs which more than offset the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization detailed above. During fiscal 2002, we also wrote off software assets totaling $14.9 million associated with certain business information integration products that were discontinued during the year as a result of the dissolution of that business unit as part of our restructuring plan. This charge is included in restructuring costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2002 and is discussed further below under the heading " Restructuring Costs." COST OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES Cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation, integration and education services that we perform for our customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. Cost of professional services decreased 6% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and 9% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date, cost of professional services declined 13%. The declines in both years resulted primarily from headcount reductions during these periods as a result of the declines in professional services revenues. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management, finance and accounting, facilities management and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services, consulting projects, insurance, costs of managing our foreign currency exposure and bad debt expense. The 8% decline in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 was primarily related to decreased personnel costs, travel costs and bad debt expense. General and administrative expenses declined 1% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of Remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date, general and administrative expenses decreased 8% primarily as a result of reduced bad debt expense, legal fees and shipping costs, which more than offset increases in personnel, insurance and travel costs. 15 ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT In executing our product strategies, we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and established software companies. We believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market, where we must compete with a variety of software vendors, and where our products must integrate with the predominant database management systems, operating systems, network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment. Accordingly, we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture. The acquired technology companies are often small software companies with minimal to no revenues, quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace. This strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans. The following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. ACQUIRED ACQUIRED GOODWILL TOTAL TECHNOLOGY IPR&D AND OTHER PRICE (IN MILLIONS) Fiscal 2001: Evity ......................................... $ 2.5 $ 7.0 $ 57.8 $ 67.3 OptiSystems ................................... 6.3 6.0 59.2 71.5 Various immaterial acquisitions ............... 14.5 3.7 18.2 36.4 $ 23.3 $ 16.7 $135.2 $175.2 Fiscal 2002: Various immaterial acquisitions ............... $ 10.5 $ $ 1.7 $ 12.2 $ 10.5 $ $ 1.7 $ 12.2 Fiscal 2003: Remedy ........................................ $109.0 $ 12.0 $235.8 $356.8 IT Masters .................................... 11.2 32.1 43.3 $120.2 $ 12.0 $267.9 $400.1 On April 25, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Evity in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The aggregate purchase price totaled $67.3 million, including cash consideration of $10.0 million, 1.0 million shares of common stock, 0.4 million common stock options and transaction costs, and was allocated as follows: $2.5 million to acquired technology, $57.8 million to goodwill and other intangibles and $7.0 million (10% of the purchase price) to purchased in process research and development (IPR&D). Net tangible assets acquired were insignificant. The amount allocated to purchased IPR&D represents the estimated fair value, based on risk adjusted cash flows, related to Evitys research and development projects not yet completed. At the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date, during the quarter ended June 30, 2000. At the acquisition date, Evity was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of SiteAngel 2.0, an enhanced version of Evitys SiteAngel website performance monitoring product, as well as new technologies in the areas of load testing and network infrastructure. The projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for the web performance market. At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were approximately 45% complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress. Evity had incurred nearly $1.0 million on the in process projects and expected to spend approximately $1.3 million to complete all phases of the research and development. Anticipated completion dates ranged from 4 to 18 months, at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies. We completed SiteAngel 2.0 during fiscal 2001 and project costs were materially consistent with managements estimates at the acquisition date. Also during fiscal 2001, the remaining projects in process at the acquisition date were suspended indefinitely. On August 8, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of OptiSystems in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The aggregate purchase price totaled $71.5 million in cash, including transaction costs, and was allocated as follows: $6.3 million to acquired technology, $55.2 million to goodwill and other intangibles, $4.0 million to equipment, receivables and other non software assets, net of liabilities assumed, and $6.0 million (8% of the purchase price) to purchased in process research and development. The amount allocated to purchased IPR&D represents the estimated fair value, based on risk adjusted cash flows, related to OptiSystems incomplete research and development projects. At the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached 16 technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date, during the quarter ended September 30, 2000. At the acquisition date, OptiSystems was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several components of its Energizer(R) for R/3 product. The projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for the enterprise application performance market. At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were approximately 50% complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress. OptiSystems had incurred approximately $1.0 million on the in process projects, and expected to spend approximately $1.2 million to complete all phases of the research and development. Anticipated completion dates ranged from 2 to 11 months, at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies. The projects have been completed and project costs were materially consistent with managements estimates at the acquisition date. We completed other immaterial acquisitions during fiscal 2001 and 2002 which were accounted for under the purchase method as indicated in the table above. On November 20, 2002, we acquired the assets of Remedy from Peregrine for $355.0 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities of Remedy. In accordance with the purchase agreement, the cash purchase price was adjusted to $347.3 million subsequent to March 31, 2003. The aggregate purchase price was $356.8 million, including the adjusted cash consideration and direct costs of the transaction. The allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities was based, in part, upon outside appraisals of the fair value of certain assets of Remedy. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. NOVEMBER 20, 2002 (IN MILLIONS) Current assets ................................ $ 32.0 Property and equipment and other long term assets ...................................... 20.1 Intangible assets ............................. 176.0 Goodwill ...................................... 199.0 Total assets acquired ...................... 427.1 Current liabilities ........................ (70.3) Net assets acquired ........................ $356.8 Of the $176.0 million of acquired intangible assets, we allocated $12.0 million (3% of the purchase price) to in process research and development projects. The amount allocated represents the estimated fair value, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to Remedys incomplete research and development projects. At the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date, during the quarter ended December 31, 2002. At the acquisition date, Remedy was conducting design, development, engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of next generation core and application technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands in the service management market. At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were approximately 25% 35% complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress. Remedy had incurred nearly $6 million on the in process projects, and expected to spend approximately $16 million to complete all phases of the research and development. Anticipated completion dates ranged from 3 to 12 months, at which times we expect to begin benefiting from the developed technologies. On March 20, 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of IT Masters in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The aggregate purchase price totaled $43.3 million in cash, including transaction costs, and was allocated as follows: $11.2 million to acquired technology, $34.8 million to goodwill and other intangibles, and $2.7 million to liabilities assumed, net of tangible assets acquired. At the acquisition date, there were no projects that had progressed to a degree that would enable the fair value of the in process research and development to be estimated with reasonable reliability and therefore no value was allocated to IPR&D. In making the purchase price allocations to IPR&D, we considered present value calculations of income, analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items, assessments of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. 17 The revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes from such projects. In the present value calculations, aggregate revenues for the Evity, OptiSystems and Remedy developed, in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately 155%, 43% and 15%, respectively, for the five years following acquisition, assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs. The estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return. Due to the nature of the forecasts and risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects, discount rates of 25% to 45% were used to value the acquired IPR&D for the various acquisitions during fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. Specifically, discount rates of 30%, 25% and 40% to 45% were used to value the acquired IPR&D for Evity, OptiSystems and Remedy, respectively. These discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. The assumptions used in valuing IPR&D were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. The IPR&D charge for fiscal 2001 also includes the write off of assets totaling $4.7 million related to a technology agreement with Envive Corporation that was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2001. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES Under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions, portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill, software and other intangible assets. Prior to April 1, 2002, we were amortizing all of these intangibles over three to five year periods, which reflected the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. As of April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." In accordance with this Statement, goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value. Acquired technology continues to be amortized under SFAS No. 86. See Note 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our reported net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share to those amounts that would have resulted had there been no amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for all periods presented. We assigned our goodwill to the applicable reporting units and tested it for impairment upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 as of April 1, 2002, and as of January 1, 2003 for the required annual testing. The fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill assigned exceeded the respective carrying value of the reporting units allocated net assets, including goodwill, and therefore no goodwill was considered impaired as of either date. During fiscal 2002, we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with various acquisitions. The assessment was performed because sustained negative economic conditions impacted our operations and expected future revenues. Economic indicators at that time suggested that such conditions could continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we recorded impairment charges of $15.5 million related to acquired technology to reflect these assets at their then current estimated net realizable values and $47.8 million related to goodwill to reflect these assets at their then current estimated fair values. These charges are reflected together with amortization expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2002, as amortization and impairment of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles. We evaluated our acquired technology under the provisions of SFAS No. 86, our other intangibles under the provisions of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long lived Assets and of Long lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and our enterprise level goodwill under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." The impairment charges for acquired technology reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated net realizable values of the products. The net realizable values for acquired technology were estimated as the future gross revenues from the products reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the products, including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support required to satisfy our responsibilities set forth at the time of sale. The impairment charges for goodwill reflect the amounts 18 by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values of these assets. Fair value was determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows related to these assets. No impairment was identified for our other intangible assets. Impairment charges by asset category were as follows: TOTAL ACQUIRED IMPAIRMENT TECHNOLOGY GOODWILL CHARGE (IN MILLIONS) Acquisition: New Dimension ....... $ 8.4 $ $ 8.4 Evity ............... 0.8 21.6 22.4 OptiSystems ......... 2.0 20.2 22.2 Perform S.A. ........ 4.3 6.0 10.3 Total ........... $15.5 $47.8 $63.3 We review the realizability of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis, and when there is an indication of impairment, we perform the procedures under the applicable accounting pronouncements to quantify any impairment that exists. Determining the amount of impairment of these assets, if any, requires that we estimate future cash flows and make judgments regarding discount rates and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of those assets, as applicable. Actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from our estimates. Future impairment charges could be material. RESTRUCTURING COSTS During fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions. This plan included the involuntary termination of 1,260 employees during the year. These actions were across all divisions and geographies and the affected employees received cash severance packages. During fiscal 2002, we also discontinued certain business information integration products as a result of the dissolution of that business unit, and announced the closure of certain locations throughout the world. A charge of $52.9 million was recorded during fiscal 2002 for employee severance, the write off of software assets related to discontinued products, net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the related technology, and office closures. During fiscal 2002, we sold our enterprise data propagation (EDP) technology for a minority equity investment in the purchaser and future cash payments to be made based on the purchasers quarterly sales to our former EDP customers over the following four years. As these products were part of the discontinued business information integration products, the proceeds will be recorded as a reduction of restructuring costs, as a recovery of the amount previously written off for these products. For fiscal 2002, proceeds of $0.2 million were recorded, reflecting the estimated fair value of the equity investment received. As the future cash payments, if any, cannot be estimated, they will be recorded in the periods received as a reduction of restructuring costs up to the amount previously written off. Any receipts in excess of the related asset write off will be reflected as other income. As of March 31, 2002, $2.6 million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the restructuring plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows: BALANCE AT PAID OUT OR BALANCE AT MARCH 31, CHARGED TO CHARGED AGAINST MARCH 31, 2001 EXPENSE RELATED ASSETS 2002 (IN MILLIONS) Severance and related expenses ................... $ $35.1 $(33.8) $ 1.3 Write off of software assets, net of proceeds received ................................ 14.7 (14.7) Facilities costs ................................. 3.1 (1.8) 1.3 Total accrual .......................... $ $52.9 $(50.3) $ 2.6 The $0.1 million credit to restructuring costs recorded during fiscal 2003 is primarily related to the net effect of adjustments to facilities and severance accruals initially recorded during fiscal 2002. As of March 31, 2003, substantially all disbursements related to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan have been paid. MERGER RELATED COSTS AND COMPENSATION CHARGES During fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, we recorded merger related compensation charges of $11.4 million, $13.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. These compensation charges are primarily related to the vesting of common stock issued as part of the Evity acquisition to certain Evity employee shareholders who we employed after the acquisition. Vesting was complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. 19 Also during fiscal 2001 and 2002, $2.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of previously accrued merger costs related to the Boole merger were reversed, as certain lease and severance obligations were satisfied at amounts below the amounts originally estimated. These reversals are reflected as a reduction of merger related costs and compensation charges in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2001 and 2002. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and finance receivables, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on short term borrowings. Other income, net decreased 23% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 9% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Other income for fiscal 2001 includes a $2.9 million one time gain related to the sale of a financial instrument and a one time $6.3 million gain related to a real estate transaction. In fiscal 2002, the decrease in other income, net primarily relates to the one time gains in the prior year discussed above, a $6.4 million loss on a marketable security and $4.6 million of impairment charges related to other equity investments. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of our payment of all short term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, the decrease in other income, net primarily relates to increased write downs of marketable securities as a result of fair value declines determined to be other than temporary totaling $13.4 million. Fiscal 2003 other income, net also included $4.5 million of impairment charges related to other equity investments. INCOME TAXES We recorded income tax expense of $18.0 million in fiscal 2001, an income tax benefit of $46.4 million in fiscal 2002, and income tax expense of $21.3 million in fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rates were 30%, 20%, and 31% for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 is a result of the impact of non deductible amortization expense in a year with a net pre tax loss. For an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates, see Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we received a Revenue Agents Report ("RAR") from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax years ended March 31, 1998 and 1999. The RAR is not a statutory notice of deficiency, and we are protesting the findings in the RAR. The RAR proposes tax increases resulting from adjustments to the transfer pricing arrangement we have with one of our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS claims in the RAR that our U.S. operations have not been adequately compensated by the foreign subsidiary for the right to distribute our technology in a specific territory. The case has been transferred to the IRS Appeals division, and we are working with the IRS Appeals division to resolve the issues. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments, and that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made, and therefore we believe that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recording income tax benefits results in the recognition of tax assets representing current tax refunds receivable from net operating loss carrybacks and or the future benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations. We evaluate the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards at each balance sheet date to determine their realizability, considering currently enacted tax laws. If we determine that the assets are not fully realizable, a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the asset balances to their realizable values through a charge to income tax expense. Determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations. Actual taxable income could differ from our estimates. As of March 31, 2003, we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and therefore no valuation allowance is recorded related to this asset. If we conclude that this tax asset requires a valuation allowance in the future, the effect on income tax expense could be material. As of March 31, 2003, we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to tax credit carryforwards will not be realized and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance for this amount. If we conclude that this tax asset requires an additional valuation allowance in the future, the effect on income tax expense could be material. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." This Statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We have elected not to adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and continue to account for our stock based employee compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations and therefore the transition provisions will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We have provided the required expanded disclosures in Note 1(k) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except for the provisions that relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. We believe that adoption of SFAS No. 149 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This Statement requires an issuer to classify specified financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity as liabilities that were previously classified either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the statement of financial position. This Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We believe that adoption of SFAS No. 150 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We believe that adoption of FIN 45 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We have provided the required disclosures in Note 9 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other interests in the entity. Currently, entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. We are in the process of evaluating the implications of FIN 46 to all variable interest entities with which we have involvement, but have determined that we will not be required to consolidate the conduit entities discussed under the heading "Liquidity and Capital Resources" under FIN 46 because the arrangements do not result in us having variable interests in the conduit entities. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We believe that adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 21 QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2003. This information has been prepared on the same basis as the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, SEPT. 30, DEC. 31, MAR. 31, JUNE 30, SEPT. 30, DEC. 31, MAR. 31, 2001 2001 2001 2002 2002 2002 2002 2003 (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) Total revenues ....................... $ 341.0 $ 295.1 $ 321.0 $ 331.8 $ 305.2 $ 291.2 $ 349.6 $ 380.7 Selling and marketing expenses ....... 152.8 132.9 128.4 124.7 119.5 112.8 129.4 137.7 Research, development and support expenses ............................ 113.0 105.8 137.2 123.2 118.2 112.4 120.5 138.8 Cost of professional services ........ 26.9 25.1 22.7 20.6 21.4 20.9 22.3 22.2 General and administrative expenses .. 41.9 40.2 36.1 33.5 36.0 35.4 41.1 37.7 Acquired research and development .... 12.0 Amortization and impairment of acquired technology, goodwill and intangibles ......................... 48.2 48.5 103.9 41.2 12.4 12.4 17.8 24.1 Restructuring costs .................. 12.0 32.7 8.2 (0.1) 0.3 (0.3) Merger related costs and compensation charges ................ 2.7 3.1 5.8 1.2 0.6 Operating income (loss) ..............

As discussed in more detail below, this decline is primarily due to cash funding for the Remedy and IT Masters acquisitions and treasury stock purchases which more than offset positive operating cash flow. Approximately two thirds of the $1,015.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2003 is held in international locations and was largely generated from our international operations. Our international operations have generated $717.2 million of earnings for which U.S. income taxes have not been recorded. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. The potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $251 million; however, we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the $717.2 million as we plan to utilize our cash in international locations for foreign investment purposes. During fiscal 2003, we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the Remedy purchase price, based upon the valuation of the foreign assets of Remedy acquired, and the IT Masters purchase price. Our working capital as of March 31, 2003, was $259.4 million, reflecting a decrease from the March 31, 2002 balance of $316.2 million due primarily to cash funding for the Remedy and IT Masters acquisitions and treasury stock purchases which more than offset positive operating cash flow. A significant dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year, and while typically yielding greater returns, investing in such securities reduces reported working capital. Our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid. Because of current economic trends, we have begun investing in securities with shorter original maturities. On December 31, 2002, we reclassified our held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio. The amortized cost recorded on the balance sheet for the transferred securities was $396.1 million at the date of reclassification. When the securities were transferred to the available for sale portfolio, a net unrealized gain of $15.8 million was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The transfer of securities from the held to maturity portfolio was made to increase our flexibility to react to the unprecedented volatility in the debt securities markets that developed over the quarters preceding the date of transfer. Stockholders equity as of March 31, 2003, was $1.4 billion. As discussed above, all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Changes in the fair values of these securities are reflected as unrealized gains and losses in stockholders equity and as a component of comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on these securities are reflected in earnings either when realized through our sale of the securities or when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining whether a value decline is other than temporary requires that we make judgments about expected future events. Actual future fair values could differ from our expectations. 22 We continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations. For the year ended March 31, 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $605.6 million. Our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses, software maintenance and professional services. We provide financing on a portion of these sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to securitize or sell a significant portion of our finance receivables, enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk. We utilize a consolidated financial subsidiary and various wholly owned, fully consolidated special purpose entities in these transfers. We securitize finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two special purpose entities sponsored by third party financial institutions. The entities sponsored by third party financial institutions are multi seller conduits with access to commercial paper markets (the conduit entities) that purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us. In a securitization transaction, we sell a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity. This special purpose entity then sells a senior interest in the receivables at a discount to a conduit entity in exchange for cash. Though wholly owned and consolidated by us, the special purpose entitys assets are legally isolated from the Companys general creditors and the conduit entitys investors have no recourse to our other assets for the failure of our customers to pay when due. We have no ownership in either of the conduit entities and have no voting influence over the conduit entities operating and financial decisions. As a result, we do not consolidate the conduit entities. When we sell receivables in securitizations, we retain a beneficial interest in the securitized receivables, which is subordinate to the interests of the investors in the conduit entities. The retained subordinate interests are measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using our best estimates of the key assumptions, including expected credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. We periodically review the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the retained subordinate interests. The value of our retained subordinate interests is subject to credit and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets. At March 31, 2002 and 2003, the fair value of our retained subordinate interests was $14.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively, and is included in long term finance receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our maximum exposure to loss at March 31, 2003, as a result of our involvement with the conduit entities is limited to the carrying value of the retained subordinate interest. Other finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During the years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, we transferred $272.6 million, $263.0 million and $376.8 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. The high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis without a negative cash flow impact. Recent shifts in various market factors have made the transfer of certain of our finance receivables more difficult and or less cost effective, including changes in the overall capacity of the market for such receivables, in customers credit quality, in the credit risk that third party financial institutions are willing to accept and in the documentation requirements of the third party financial institutions. These factors may impact our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future. Beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the change in long term finance receivables has been reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities, whereas this was previously reported as a component of cash flows from investing activities. All periods presented have been reclassified for consistency. The change in long term finance receivables decreased net cash provided by operating activities by $13.7 million in fiscal 2001, and increased net cash provided by operating activities by $60.0 million and $0.5 million for fiscal 2002 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $249.5 million, primarily related to the Remedy and IT Masters acquisitions, as discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities during the period. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $186.7 million, which primarily related to purchases of our common stock. On April 24, 2000, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500.0 million in common stock, and on July 30, 2002, they authorized the purchase of an additional $500.0 million. During the year ended March 31, 2003, we purchased 13.5 million shares for $211.6 million. From the inception of the repurchase plan through March 31, 2003, we have purchased 29.7 million shares for $521.8 million. We plan to continue to buy our common stock and intend to purchase between $200 million and $300 million of common stock during fiscal 2004, subject to market conditions and other possible uses of our cash. We have no short term or long term debt outstanding. Our obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are $72.6 million in fiscal 2004, $63.5 million in fiscal 2005, $53.8 million in fiscal 2006, $44.7 million in fiscal 2007, $31.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $58.9 million in fiscal 2009 and beyond. 23 We believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some, but not all, of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. WE MAY EXPERIENCE A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE IN ANY GIVEN QUARTER OR MAY ANNOUNCE LOWER FORECASTED REVENUE OR EARNINGS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. Our revenue is difficult to forecast and is likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors outside of our control. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter, and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues, earnings, cash flows and or changes to the deferred license revenue balances will have met expectations until the first few days of the following quarter. Any significant revenue shortfall or lowered forecasts could cause our stock price to decline substantially. Factors that could affect our financial results include, but are not limited to: o the possibility that our customers may defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets, reduced data processing capacity demand or the current weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions; o the possibility that our customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us; o the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our products in anticipation of new products or product updates from us or our competitors; o the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of our sales through direct sales channels, value added resellers and distributors, which tend to occur late in each quarter; o an unexpected increase in license transactions that require revenues to be deferred or recognized ratably over time rather than upfront; o the timing of new product introductions by us and the market acceptance of new products, which may be delayed as a result of weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions; o changes in our pricing and distribution terms or those of our competitors; and o the possibility that our business will be adversely affected as a result of the threat of significant external events that increase global economic uncertainty. Investors should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance. Our operating expense levels are based, in significant part, on our expectations of future revenue. If we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses proportionally in response. Therefore, any significant shortfall in revenue will likely have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter. DECREASING DEMAND FOR ENTERPRISE LICENSE TRANSACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES. Fees from enterprise license transactions have historically been a fundamental component of our revenues. These revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their computer processing capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater processing capacity in future periods. Prior to 2000, we licensed many of our larger customers to operate our mainframe products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current mainframe processing capacity. During the past several years, we also entered into many enterprise license agreements with our larger customers to operate our distributed systems products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current distributed processing capacity. In a weak economy, these customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us. If economic conditions weaken further, demand for data processing capacity could decline. In addition, the uncertain economic environment has reduced customers expectations of future capacity growth, thus lessening demand for licensing excess processing capacity in anticipation of future growth. In the past, customers tended to renew their enterprise license agreements prior to their expiration. Recent experience indicates that some customers renew early while other customers continue to operate under their existing capacity. Sustained sluggishness in IT and capital spending can result in customers engaging in contract renewal discussions later than we anticipate. These factors make it difficult to anticipate the size and timing of renewals of enterprise licenses. If our 24 customers who have entered into multi year capacity based licenses for excess processing capacity do not increase their processing capacity beyond the levels previously licensed from us or license additional processing capacity in anticipation of future growth, then our license revenues may not grow and our earnings could be adversely affected. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACHIEVING OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS GOAL. Our quarterly cash flow is and has been volatile. If our cash generated from operations proved in some future period to be materially less than the market expects, the market price of our common stock could decline. Factors that could adversely affect our cash flow from operations in the future include: reduced net earnings; increased time required for the collection of accounts receivable; an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable; a significant shift from multi year committed contracts to short term contracts; a reduced ability to transfer finance receivables to third parties; reduced renewal rates for maintenance; and a reduced yield from marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents balances. MAINTENANCE REVENUE COULD DECLINE. Maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run. Maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases; consequently, we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity. Due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity, the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products. In addition, customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement. These discounts, combined with reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts and the recent decline in our license revenues, have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue, excluding the impact of Remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date. Further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting would lead to declines in our maintenance revenues. Although renewal rates remain high, should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products, increased cancellations could lead to declines in our maintenance revenue. OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE. Our stock price has been and is highly volatile. Our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of future revenue, earnings and cash flows. Any failure to meet anticipated revenue, earnings and cash flow levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price. INTENSE COMPETITION AND PRICING PRESSURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. The market for systems management software is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of software vendors including IBM, Hewlett Packard (HP), Computer Associates (CA) and a number of smaller software vendors. We derived approximately half of our total revenues in fiscal 2003 from software products for IBM and IBM compatible mainframe computers. IBM continues, directly and through third parties, to enhance and market its utilities for IMS and DB2 as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors. Although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions, IBM continues to invest in the IMS and DB2 utility market and appears to be committed to competing in these markets. If IBM is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our IMS, DB2 and other products at a lower cost, our business would be materially adversely affected. As a large hardware vendor and outsourcer of IT services, IBM has the ability to bundle its other goods and services with its software and offer packaged solutions to customers which could result in increased pricing pressure. To date, our solutions have competed well against IBMs because we have developed advanced automation and artificial intelligence features and our utilities have maintained a speed advantage. In addition, we believe that because we provide enterprise management solutions across multiple platforms we are better positioned to provide customers with comprehensive management solutions for their complex multi vendor IT environments than integrated hardware and software companies like IBM. CA is also competing with us in these markets. Competition has led to increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets. We continue to reduce the cost to our customers of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to such competitive pressures. Although to date we have not experienced significant competition from Microsoft, their dominant position in the operating system market makes them capable of exerting competitive pressure in the systems management market as well. We also face competition from several niche software vendors, particularly for our distributed systems product lines. In addition, the software industry is experiencing continued consolidation. There is a risk that some of our competitors may combine and consolidate market positions or combine technology, making them stronger competitors. 25 OUR PRODUCTS MUST REMAIN COMPATIBLE WITH EVER CHANGING OPERATING AND DATABASE ENVIRONMENTS. IBM, HP, Sun, Microsoft and Oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and, in many cases, are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, database systems, systems software and computer hardware. Such new products could incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. Although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY SOURCE CODE. In the past, licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with "source code," which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers, and "object code," which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation. Since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software which must interface with the operating systems, independent software vendors such as BMC were able to develop and market compatible software. IBM and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems. To date, this policy has not had a material effect on us. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON EARLY ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY OPERATING AND DATABASE SYSTEMS. Operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available (GA) versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. FAILURE TO ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS. If we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry, such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. During the past several years, many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace. The distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets. Our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors, including the success of our existing distributed systems products, the timely introduction and success of future software products, and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products. We have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past, particularly with some of our distributed systems products, and expect to have delays in the future. Delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. New products or new versions of existing products may, despite testing, contain undetected errors or bugs that could delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products. 26 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL CHANNELS IN THE FUTURE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND EARNINGS. With the acquisition of Remedy, the percentage of our revenue from sales of our products and services through distribution channels such as systems integrators and value added resellers is increasing. Conducting business through indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks, including: o each of our systems integrators and value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty; o our existing systems integrators and value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell new products and services that we may introduce; o we do not have direct control over the business practices adopted by our systems integrators and value added resellers; o our systems integrators and value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services; o we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities; and o our systems integrators and value added resellers may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products. CHANGES IN PRICING PRACTICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND EARNINGS. We may choose to make changes to our product packaging, pricing or licensing programs in response to customer demands or as a means to differentiate our product offerings. If made, such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings. OUR CUSTOMERS MAY NOT ACCEPT OUR PRODUCT STRATEGIES. Historically, we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications. Our BSM strategy requires us to integrate multiple software products so that they work together to provide comprehensive systems management solutions. There can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions. In addition, there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions. We may also adopt different sales strategies for marketing our products, and there can be no assurance that our strategies for selling solutions will be successful. RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. As part of our overall strategy, we have acquired or invested in, and plan to continue to acquire or invest in, complementary companies, products, and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include: the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies; the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business; the inability to retain key technical, sales and managerial personnel; the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses; the risk that revenues from acquired companies, products and technologies do not meet expectations; and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets. For us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable, especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits. 27 With each of our acquisitions, we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures, employees, systems and products of these companies. Retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement, development, support, sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products. We have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical, sales and marketing employees of acquired companies; nonetheless, we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future. ENFORCEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. POSSIBILITY OF INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights. We expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products overlaps. In addition, we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents, especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years. Regardless of its merit, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected. RISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. We have committed, and expect to continue to commit, substantial resources and funding to build our international infrastructure. Operating costs in many countries, including many of those in which we operate, are higher than in the United States. To increase international sales in fiscal 2004 and subsequent periods, we must continue to globalize our software product lines; expand existing and establish additional foreign operations; hire additional personnel; identify suitable locations for sales, marketing, customer service and development; and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories. Future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices, particularly our European operations. Our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Generally, our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies. If these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly, we could have significant gains or losses. We maintain a software development and information technology operations office in India which operates as an extension of our primary development and information technology operations and we contract with third party developers in India. As other software companies have done and are continuing to do, we plan to continue to allocate more development and IT resources to India with the expectation of achieving significant efficiencies, including reducing operational costs and permitting an around the clock development cycle. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region has not adversely affected our operations in India. Should we be unable to conduct operations in India in the future, we believe that our business could be temporarily adversely affected. We conduct substantial development and marketing operations in Israel and, accordingly, we are directly affected by economic, political and military conditions in Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans, and to date, the current conflict in the region and hostilities within Israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in Israel. 28 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS UNDER CONSIDERATION RELATED TO STOCK BASED COMPENSATION WOULD REDUCE OUR REPORTED EARNINGS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL BY REDUCING THE STOCK BASED COMPENSATION WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. We have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage employees to remain with BMC Software. In accounting for our stock option grants using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, we recognize no compensation cost because the exercise price of options granted is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently considering changes to US generally accepted accounting principles that, if implemented, would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants, which would negatively impact our earnings. For example, as disclosed in Note 1(k) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, recording charges for employee stock options using the fair value method under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" would have reduced net earnings by $83.0 million, $84.0 million and $62.4 million for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. In addition, new regulations proposed by The New York Stock Exchange requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans as well as new regulations prohibiting NYSE member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future. To the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or costly to grant options to employees, we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, either of which could materially adversely affect our business. POSSIBLE ADVERSE IMPACT OF INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. On April 1, 1998 and 1999 we adopted AICPA SOP 97 2, "Software Revenue Recognition," and SOP 98 9 "Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions," respectively. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Based on our reading and interpretation of these SOPs, we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. Future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK We operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non U.S. enterprises is the local currency. For fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, approximately 43%, 42% and 44% of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of North America, substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies. Similarly, substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies. As a result, our U.S. dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk: forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used to reduce currency exposure associated with our rights and obligations denominated in foreign currencies that subject us to transaction risk. The terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month. Forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts, with terms generally less than one year, are used to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, sales transactions. Principal currencies hedged are the Euro and British pound in Europe, the Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the Asia Pacific region and the Israeli shekel. While we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal 2001, 2002 or 2003. 29 Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2003, we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of $3.9 million based on a value at risk ("VAR") model utilizing Monte Carlo simulation. The comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2002 was $2.4 million utilizing the same model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The average VAR for the period was $3.1 million for fiscal 2003 and $4.1 million for fiscal 2002. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. INTEREST RATE RISK INVESTMENTS We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated $1.0 billion at March 31, 2003, and were primarily invested in different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. Based on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2003, we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the investments. We used a VAR variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
