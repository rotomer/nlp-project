ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) with an overview to give the reader managements perspective on our results for fiscal 2006 and our general outlook for the next fiscal year. This is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. This discussion is followed by a review of our recent, significant acquisitions. In the next section, we discuss our Results of Operations for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. We then discuss the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on our future reported results and provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources. 18 Table of Contents This MDA should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Risk Factors, Business and Selected Financial Data above and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. MDA contains a number of forward looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Risk Factors section above. Our actual results may differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements. Overview Fiscal 2006 proved to be a solid year of improvement for us, as we extended our leadership in Business Service Management (BSM) and introduced new offerings that broaden and deepen our BSM portfolio. Leading industry analyst firms have validated BSM as a primary way for IT organizations to proactively and effectively align with the goals of business. They expect the number of companies implementing BSM to increase substantially within the next few years. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this important market trend. We have developed the only second generation, completely federated configuration management database or CMDB. It is an essential first step for implementing BSM. The BMC Atrium CMDB is the only all in one integrated, federated solution. Our research identified Transaction Management as a large and emerging market. Through the combination of internal development and an acquisition, we responded to a key customer need identifying, analyzing, and resolving problems that affect transactions before they impact critical business services. During the fourth quarter, we introduced BMC Transaction Management solutions, which provide the tools needed to measure and manage the performance of business transactions from the end user perspective across complex, heterogeneous computing environments. In connection with this, we announced our fourth quarter acquisition of Identify Software Ltd. (Identify), a leading global provider of application problem resolution and lifecycle management software. Identifys state of the art technology offers problem resolution capabilities that directly impact the way that IT serves a customers business goals. Identifys product has unique transaction problem resolution capabilities through root cause analysis, capture, and playback. We view this as a growth opportunity for us, as we now have access to buyers in the application testing and development market. Identify is now part of our new Transaction Management organization. Our acquisition of Identify and our more significant business combinations are discussed in greater detail under Acquisitions below. We also continue to realize the positive benefits of our cost management actions earlier in the year, in terms of improved operating efficiency and profitability. During the first quarter, we implemented a plan focused mainly on reducing and aligning costs with revenues and eliminating excess overhead. This fiscal 2006 plan is discussed in greater detail under Results of Operations below. We continued our commitment to enhance shareholder value by significantly increasing the cash returned to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately 20.5 million shares for a total value of $411.0 million. During fiscal 2006, we continued to emphasize the importance of providing the flexibility that our customers need when it comes to structuring their license arrangements. As we met those customer preferences, we again reported an increase in the volume of transactions that required deferral of license fees and recognition of such fees ratably over the terms of the contracts. In fiscal 2006, approximately 41% of our license transactions were deferred as compared to approximately 37% in fiscal 2005. Given the continued increase in deferred license revenue during fiscal 2006, license transactions remains a key metric for us as it reflects the amount of new license contracts (bookings) signed during a given period. License transactions can be calculated from our Consolidated Financial Statements by adding current period license revenue, 19 Table of Contents the net change in deferred license revenue and the beginning balance allocated from acquisitions, all calculated according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our license transactions for fiscal 2006 declined 10% from fiscal 2005 as our Distributed Systems Management and Mainframe Management businesses had lower license transactions, which paralleled industry performance. The Service Management and Identity Management businesses, integral to our BSM strategy, experienced strong license transactions growth. We believe its appropriate to focus on license transactions or bookings growth as a leading indicator of the performance of our Service Management and Identity Management businesses, given their high growth potential. For fiscal 2006, Service Management license bookings were up 6%, and Identity Management license bookings rose 20%. It is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter, and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter. If we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter, there is an immediate, sometimes significant, effect on our overall earnings and our stock price. Industry Conditions While the overall IT spending environment has stabilized, IT budgets have remained relatively flat. Additionally, IT organizations continue to be pressured by their business counterparts to lower overall operational costs while increasing support for regulatory compliance, strategic objectives and other projects focused on delivering increased value to the business. While our BSM solutions allow our customers to improve their IT processes and effectively align IT with business needs, the demands placed on customers IT organizations have resulted in an environment less conducive to closing large deals and increased pricing pressures on technology vendors. While we believe BSM differentiates us from our competitors, we recognize that the systems management software market place is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of software vendors, including large vendors such as IBM, HP, CA, and a number of smaller software vendors. We compete for new customers and, from time to time, must compete to maintain our relationships with our current customers. This competition can lead to pricing pressure and can affect our margins. We discuss competition in greater detail under Business and Risk Factors above. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, acquired technology, in process research and development, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses, the carrying values of assets, and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. 20 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We generate revenues from licensing software, providing maintenance, enhancement and support for previously licensed products and, to a lesser extent, from providing professional services. We recognize revenue in accordance with AICPA SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions for all transactions including the sale of software licenses and services. We recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met: (i) a legally binding, written arrangement is executed, (ii) delivery has occurred and acceptance, to the extent required, is received, (iii) arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the arrangement fee is deemed probable. If we determine that any one of the four criteria is not met, we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are met, as required by SOPs 97 2 and 98 9. License revenues consist of fees charged for the use of our software products licensed under perpetual or term agreements. Substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements (i.e., licenses are sold either with maintenance or with maintenance and professional services). Perpetual license revenues included in multiple element arrangements are recognized under the residual method, such that the consideration is allocated to the various other undelivered elements included in the agreement based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of those elements, with the residual being allocated to license revenues. Revenues allocated to the undelivered elements of a contract are deferred until such time as those elements are delivered or the services are rendered. We have established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance through the renewal rates in the contractual arrangements with our customers and through independent sales of maintenance at these stated renewal rates. These renewal rates reflect a consistent relationship by pricing maintenance as a percentage of the discounted or undiscounted license list price. Vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of professional services is based on the daily rates determined from our contracts for services alone, which are time and materials based. In the event a contract contains multiple elements for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or deferred until those elements are delivered or are recognized on a ratable basis. We have not established vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements in arrangements which include software products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements which include unlimited licensing rights, arrangements which include products with differing maintenance periods and arrangements which include rights to future unspecified software licenses. License arrangements including these undelivered elements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Term license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of maintenance in these arrangements. When software licenses are sold together with professional services, the majority of license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the product as we do not provide significant customization of software products and the professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software. We also execute arrangements with agents, distributors and resellers (collectively, resellers). Resellers act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our software, and the rewards of ownership are passed to the resellers upon the execution of our arrangement with them. We recognize revenues from transactions with resellers on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the resellers). We do not offer a right of return, rotation or price protection in our sales to resellers, and it is our policy to only accept orders from resellers that specifically name an end user. Revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. If the fee under an arrangement is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or the risk of concession is considered to be high, we recognize revenue upon cash receipt. Capitalized Software Development Costs 21 Table of Contents Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until the products general release to customers in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the products estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. Under SFAS No. 86, we evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value as defined by SFAS No. 86 requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenues as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs. The impact of accelerated amortization on fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 results is discussed in greater detail under Results of Operations Cost of License Revenues below. Acquired Technology, In Process Research and Development, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values are estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach, which requires us to project the related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. Once the acquired assets are recorded, we amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives. We analyze the realizability of our acquired technology each quarter. All goodwill and those intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value. When conducting these realizability and impairment assessments, we are required to estimate future cash flows. The estimates used in valuing all intangible assets, including in process research and development, are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives. Incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Valuation of Investments Our investments primarily consist of marketable debt and equity securities. We account for our marketable investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We regularly analyze our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment. This analysis requires significant judgment. The primary factors considered when determining if an impairment charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is other than temporary include whether: (i) the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis; (ii) the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated; (iii) if a debt security, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security; (iv) the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time; (v) if a debt security, such security has been downgraded by a rating agency; and (vi) we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities. However, from time to time, issuer specific and market specific events, as described above, could warrant an impairment write down. As the vast majority of our marketable securities are investment grade debt securities, we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Marketable securities with a fair value below our cost as of March 31, 2005 and 2006 are discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Income Taxes 22 Table of Contents We account for the effect of income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current years results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. We are required to make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine (i) our income tax expense or benefit, (ii) our deferred tax assets and liabilities and (iii) whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic (including state) and foreign authorities. These factors significantly impact the amounts we record related to income taxes. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets take into account positive and negative evidence about possible sources of taxable income available under the tax laws to realize the tax benefit, including projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and the amounts that may be realized utilizing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of taxable income in future years could differ from our estimates and the related impact on our income tax expense or benefit could materially affect our consolidated results of operations. We are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires significant judgments and estimates. We evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of SFAS No. 5. We also have various domestic and foreign income tax exposures that do not meet the probable and or estimable criteria of SFAS No. 5 and therefore no tax expense has been accrued. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these exposures could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. Acquisitions In February 2004, we acquired the assets of Magic from McAfee, formerly known as Network Associates, for $49.3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities of Magic. The acquisition strengthened our leadership position in the service management market by increasing our reach to small and mid market sized organizations, as Magic had more than 4,000 customers using its service desk solutions. The acquisition of Marimba in July 2004 for $230.3 million in cash plus stock options valued at $20.9 million provided new and extended capabilities to our BSM offerings in the areas of change and configuration management, security management and infrastructure management, enabling our customers to rapidly respond to changing business requirements by re purposing, re provisioning and updating IT resources to achieve required IT configurations. In January 2005, we acquired Calendra for $33.1 million in cash, and in March 2005, we acquired the assets of OpenNetwork for cash of $18.0 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of OpenNetwork. These two acquisitions completed our transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a complete suite provider. The combination of our CONTROL SA provisioning solution with Calendras state of the art business process centric workflow and directory management capabilities, eliminated integration issues typically faced by customers purchasing individual components from multiple vendors. The OpenNetwork acquisition expanded our Identity Management product suite to include browser based authentication and authorization solutions that enable customers to securely manage access to Web based applications across multiple business environments. In August 2005, we acquired KMXperts Inc. for cash of $5.3 million. The acquisition strengthens our knowledge management solutions for IT service and customer support centers. These transactions, along with various other less significant technology acquisitions, have been accounted for using the purchase accounting method, and accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. 23 Table of Contents Subsequent to fiscal 2006, on May 10, 2006, BMC Software Israel, Limited, an Israeli company and wholly owned subsidiary of BMC Israel, and BMC completed the acquisition of Identify Software Ltd., an Israeli company, pursuant to which BMC Israel purchased from the shareholders of Identify Software Ltd. all of the issued and outstanding capital stock for approximately $150 million in cash. This acquisition extends capabilities to our BSM offerings in the area of transaction management through Identify Software Ltd.s application problem resolution software. The addition of Identify Software Ltds solutions to BMCs transaction management strategy will provide customers with deep application and problem resolution capabilities, enabling them to pinpoint the cause of transaction breakdowns. Historical Information Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income (loss) or net earnings (loss) will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating results, see Risk Factors above. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the percentages that selected items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) bear to total revenues.

We generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products, support and services are sold to our customers. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. We acquired Marimba and other smaller companies in fiscal 2005, as discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the impact of companies acquired in fiscal 2004 and 2005, total revenues declined 2% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of a decline in license revenues. Weakness in IT spending and customer procurement process slowdowns early in fiscal 2005 and lower license transactions for our distributed systems business contributed to this decline. Including revenues of acquired companies, total revenues increased 3% in fiscal 2005. Product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Total revenues grew 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of a 7% growth in maintenance revenues, partially offset by a 4% decline in license revenues. Our maintenance revenues have grown year over year in each of our product categories primarily due to an increase in our installed customer base. License revenues declined in each of our product categories, except in Service Management, due to various competitive pressures described below. Product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal 2006.

Certain reclassifications in prior periods have been made for consistency. Our solutions are broadly divided into four core product categories. The Mainframe Management product category includes products designed for managing database management systems on mainframe platforms. The Distributed Systems Management product category includes our systems management and monitoring, distributed data management, scheduling and output management solutions. The Service Management product category includes our service, change and asset management solutions, IT discovery and software configuration management solutions. The Identity Management product category includes products that facilitate user administration and provisioning, password administration, enterprise directory management, web access control and audit and compliance management. Mainframe Management license revenues represented 38.5%, or $222.2 million, 34.8%, or $190.2 million, and 33.5%, or $176.6 million, of our total license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Mainframe Management license revenues for fiscal 2005 decreased 14.4%, or $32.0 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 previously due to declines consistent with the overall trends in the mainframe market. Mainframe Management license revenues for fiscal 2006 decreased 7.2%, or $13.8 million, from fiscal 2005 due to a decline in license transactions for Mainframe Management products, which is indicative of a highly competitive, mature market. Mainframe Management maintenance revenues represented 40.9%, or $309.6 million, 37.0%, or $305.4 million, and 36.7%, or $322.6 million, of our total maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Total maintenance revenues for Mainframe Management decreased 1.4%, or $4.2 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to declines for the Mainframe products. Total maintenance revenues for Mainframe Management increased 5.6%, or $17.2 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 due to the increase in our installed customer base as a result of our strong market presence. Distributed Systems Management license revenues represented 37.2%, or $214.6 million, 33.5%, or $183.0 million, and 30.2%, or $159.3 million, of our total license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Distributed Systems Management license revenues decreased 14.7%, or $31.6 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of a decrease in license transactions across all products. The decline in license transactions was primarily for our Distributed Systems Data Management products as a result of increased competition from database providers in this market and for our PATROL products as we are undergoing a product transition for this product line, integrating our agent based and agentless PATROL technologies. Distributed Systems Management license revenues decreased 13.0%, or $23.7 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of a decrease in license transactions year over year due to increased competitive pressure in the markets we serve. Distributed Systems Management maintenance revenues represented 35.3%, or $267.0 million, 34.0%, or $279.9 million, and 31.9%, or $280.3 million, of our total maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Total maintenance revenues for this group increased 4.8%, or $12.9 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 26 Table of Contents 2005 and 0.1%, or $0.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 due to an increase in our installed customer base, partially offset by the decline in annual license transactions closed. Service Management license revenues represented 22.1%, or $127.6 million, 29.9%, or $163.6 million, and 34.5%, or $181.8 million, of our total license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Total license revenues for Service Management increased 28.2%, or $36.0 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to the acquisitions of Magic and Marimba in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the second quarter of fiscal 2005, respectively, and growth of Remedys core business. Total license revenues for Service Management increased 11.1%, or $18.2 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 due to growth in license transactions as a result of our competitive products and reputation in the market, coupled with recognition of previously deferred transactions that are recognized over time. Service Management maintenance revenues represented 21.7%, or $164.0 million, 27.2%, or $223.9 million, and 29.3%, or $257.3 million, of our total maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Total Service Management maintenance revenues increased 36.5%, or $59.9 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and 14.9%, or $33.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to 2006 due to an increase in our installed customer base, high renewal rates for Remedy products and the positive impact of a full year of maintenance revenues for the Marimba products. Identity Management license revenues represented 2.3%, or $13.0 million, 1.8%, or $9.7 million, and 1.8%, or $9.3 million, of our total license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Total license revenues for Identity Management decreased 25.4%, or $3.3 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Our acquisitions of Calendra in January 2005 and OpenNetwork in March 2005 gave us the tools to transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a suite provider. Total license revenues for Identity Management decreased 4.1%, or $0.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we experienced sales declines as we transitioned the new Calendra and OpenNetwork acquisitions. In the second half of fiscal 2006, we released Idm 5.0, completing the transition of BMC to a complete suite provider which resulted in less of a year over year decline than experienced in the prior year. Identity Management maintenance revenues represented 2.1%, or $15.8 million, 1.8%, or $15.1 million, and 2.1%, or $18.6 million, of our total maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Maintenance revenue for Identity Management saw a strong growth rate in fiscal 2006 due to an increase in our installed customer base as well as continued maintenance renewals. Product License Revenues Our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis. Product license fees can be associated with a customers licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customers purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or for additional users. Our license revenues also include term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time. License revenues decreased 5.4%, or $30.9 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and 3.6%, or $19.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The continued decrease in license revenues is the result of the negative impact of a highly competitive, mature Mainframe Management market and the increased competitive pressure in our Distributed Systems Management market, partially offset by the positive impact of our increased market share in Service Management. The decrease in license revenue is the combined result of a decrease in total transactions and a decrease in the percentage of new license sales recognized upfront. Recognized license revenues plus the net change in deferred license revenues for the period, representing the license value of transactions completed in the period, decreased during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 compared to the respective prior year periods. The value of license transactions for fiscal 2005 and 2006 were down 13% and 11%, respectively, from the prior year periods. We closed 66 transactions over $1 million during fiscal 2006, including two transactions over $10 million, a decrease from 86 such transactions, including two transactions over $10 million, in fiscal 2005 and a decrease from 97 such transactions in fiscal 2004, including four transactions over $10 million. The total license value of these 66 transactions in fiscal 2006 was $165.3 million, including amounts recognized and deferred, compared to $237.7 million and $287.9 million for these transactions in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the current fiscal year transactions, the percentage of revenue recognized upfront has decreased from 63% a year ago to 59%. Term contracts are time based arrangements which allow the licensee or customer to use our software for a specified period of time. Thus, the associated value of the contract is recognized ratably over the life of the contract. 27 Table of Contents Deferred Product License Revenues For fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, our recognized license revenues were impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Deferrals of license revenue $ (239.2 ) $ (226.1 ) $ (228.2 ) Recognition from deferred license revenue 105.0 155.7 203.1 Net impact on recognized license revenue $ (134.2 ) $ (70.4 ) $ (25.1 ) Deferred license revenue balance at end of year $ 336.8 $ 407.2 $ 432.2 The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include: customer transactions that contain certain complex contractual terms and conditions, customer transactions which include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements which include unlimited licensing rights, time based licenses which are recognized over the term of the arrangement, or customer transactions which include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and or professional services. All of these instances cause the license revenues to be deferred under the residual method of accounting for multiple element arrangements. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenues as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenues to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred license revenue balance. As of March 31, 2006, the deferred license revenue balance was $432.2 million and had an average remaining life of approximately three years. As additional license revenues are deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred license revenues we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2006 is as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2007 $ 203.0 Fiscal 2008 $ 129.5 Fiscal 2009 and thereafter $ 99.7 Maintenance, Enhancement and Support Revenues Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance, enhancement and support program. Maintenance, enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements, technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems, database management systems, networks, storage systems and applications. These fees are generally charged annually and are based on the discounted license list price for legacy BMC Software products and a percentage of the undiscounted license list price for Service Management and Identity Management products. Customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement. The majority of our maintenance revenues are generated by such long term contracts. Maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related license agreement. Maintenance revenues can have quarterly fluctuations based on the timing of contracts, renewal rates and the number of new license contracts. Maintenance fees increase with new license and maintenance agreements and as 28 Table of Contents existing customers install our products on additional processing capacity or add users. However, discounts on licensed products tend to increase for purchases with higher levels of processing capacity, so that maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements. These discounts, combined with an increase in long term maintenance contracts with reduced maintenance percentages and the reduced number of new license contracts, excluding our Service Management products, have led to a lower fiscal 2006 growth rate for our maintenance revenues. Maintenance revenues increased 9.0%, or $67.9 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and 6.6%, or $54.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the increase in our installed customer base in all core product categories. As of March 31, 2006, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,175.1 million. As additional maintenance revenues are deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred maintenance revenues we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2006 are as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2007 $ 587.6 Fiscal 2008 $ 325.8 Fiscal 2009 thereafter $ 261.7 Domestic vs. International Revenues Percentage Change 2005 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2004 2005 2006 2004 2005 (In millions) License: Domestic $ 258.7 $ 256.2 $ 263.2 (1.0 )% 2.7 % International 318.7 290.3 263.8 (8.9 )% (9.1 )% Total license revenues 577.4 546.5 527.0 (5.4 )% (3.6 )% Maintenance: Domestic 433.3 462.6 490.0 6.8 % 5.9 % International 323.1 361.7 388.8 11.9 % 7.5 % Total maintenance revenues 756.4 824.3 878.8 9.0 % 6.6 % Professional services: Domestic 40.6 40.2 41.2 (1.0 )% 2.5 % International 44.3 52.0 51.4 17.4 % (1.2 )% Total professional services revenues 84.9 92.2 92.6 8.6 % 0.4 % Total revenues $ 1,418.7 $ 1,463.0 $ 1,498.4 3.1 % 2.4 % License Revenue Our domestic operations generated 44.8%, or $258.7 million, 46.9%, or $256.2 million, and 50.0%, or $263.2 million, of license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. From fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, domestic license revenue decreased 1.0%, or $2.5 million, due to declines in Mainframe Management and Distributed Systems Management partially offset by growth in the Service Management business unit. From fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 domestic license revenue increased 2.7%, or $7.0 million, due to growth in Service Management, Mainframe Management and Identity Management, partially offset by a decline in Distributed Systems. International license revenues represented 55.2%, or $318.7 million, 53.1%, or $290.3 million, and 50.0%, or $263.5 million, of license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006. International license revenues decreased 8.9%, or $28.4 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to relatively consistent declines in license transactions across all international areas and across all business units. From fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, international license revenue decreased 9.2%, or $26.8 million, primarily due to license transaction declines in Europe and an increased ratable rate in Asia Pacific as well as declines in Mainframe and Distributed Systems and only a marginal growth in Service 29 Table of Contents Management. The Western European and Asia Pacific markets continue to be extremely competitive markets. Maintenance Revenue Our domestic operations generated 57.3%, or $433.3 million, 56.1%, or $462.6 million, and 55.8%, or $490.0 million, of maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006. From fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, domestic maintenance revenue increased 6.8%, or $29.3 million, due to growth the Service Management business. From fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 domestic maintenance revenue increased 5.9%, or $27.4 million, due to growth in Service Management, Mainframe Management and Identity Management from a growing install base, partially offset by a slight decline in Distributed Systems. Our international operations generated 42.7%, or $323.1 million, 43.9%, or $361.7 million, and 44.2%, or $388.8 million, of maintenance revenues for the same periods. From fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, international maintenance revenue increased 11.9%, or $38.6 million due to growth in Distributed Systems Management and Service Management. From fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, international maintenance revenue increased 7.5%, or $27.1 million due to growth in install base. Foreign currency exchange rate changes, including the impact of hedging, resulted in a favorable impact to the growth in international license revenues of 3.4%, or $10.7 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and an unfavorable impact of 0.3%, or $0.9 million, from fiscal 2005 to 2006. Professional Services Revenues Professional services revenues, representing fees from implementation, integration and education services performed during the periods, increased 8.6%, or $7.3 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and 0.4%, or $0.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Domestic professional services revenue decreased 1.0%, or $0.4 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, but were offset by an increase in the international market. International professional services revenue increased 17.4%, or $7.7 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to growth from Service Management. Domestic professional services revenue increased 2.5%, or $1.0 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, which includes a positive impact in fiscal 2006 from expired deposits. International professional services revenue decreased 1.2%, or $0.6 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, the professional services management team has made a strategic shift to focus on large, leading edge BSM implementations which will result in lower contract volume, but higher contract values in the future.

The workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages. We also exited leases in certain locations, reduced the square footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities. The relocation efforts for the FY2004 Plan were completed as of December 31, 2003. Accretion (the increase in the present value of facilities accruals over time) and adjustments to the original estimates are included in operating expenses. Charges for exit costs of $110.1 million were recorded in fiscal 2004, for employee severance and related costs and exited leases. Additionally, $14.1 million of incremental depreciation expense was recorded during the year, related to changes in estimated depreciable lives for leasehold improvements in locations exited and for certain information technology assets that were eliminated as a result of the plan. These changes in estimated lives reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.05 for fiscal 2004. The expenses related to the exit activities are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2004 as follows: Severance Related Incremental Year Ended March 31, 2004: Costs Facilities Depreciation Total (In millions) Cost of license revenues $ 2.2 $ 8.4 $ 1.6 $ 12.2 Cost of maintenance revenues 3.5 14.2 2.8 20.5 Cost of professional services 2.4 2.4 Selling and marketing expenses 17.5 34.0 5.0 56.5 Research and development expenses 4.8 19.8 4.0 28.6 General and administrative expenses 3.1 0.2 0.7 4.0 Total included in operating expenses $ 33.5 $ 76.6 $ 14.1 $ 124.2 As of March 31, 2006, $25.6 million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the FY2004 Plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows: Balance at Cash Payments, Balance at March 31, Charged to Adjustments Net of Sublease March 31, 2003 Expense Accretion to Estimates Income 2004 (In millions) Severance and related costs $ $ 33.5 $ $ $ (29.6 ) $ 3.9 Facilities costs 75.6 0.7 0.3 (11.9 ) 64.7 Total accrual $ $ 109.1 $ 0.7 $ 0.3 $ (41.5 ) $ 68.6 Balance at Effect of Cash Payments, Balance at March 31, Adjustments Exchange Rate Net of Sublease March 31, 2004 Accretion to Estimates Changes Income 2005 (In millions) Severance and related costs $ 3.9 $ $ (0.1 ) $ 0.2 $ (2.9 ) $ 1.1 Facilities costs 64.7 1.8 (3.4 ) 0.2 (23.2 ) 40.1 Total accrual $ 68.6 $ 1.8 $ (3.5 ) $ 0.4 $ (26.1 ) $ 41.2 Balance at Effect of Cash Payments, Balance at March 31, Adjustments Exchange Rate Net of Sublease March 31, 2005 Accretion to Estimates Changes Income 2006 (In millions) Severance and related costs $ 1.1 $ $ (0.5 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 0.2 Facilities costs 40.1 1.4 (1.7 ) (0.1 ) (14.3 ) 25.4 Total accrual $ 41.2 $ 1.4 $ (2.2 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (14.6 ) $ 25.6 The FY2004 Plan amounts accrued at March 31, 2006 related to facilities costs represent the remaining fair value of lease obligations for exited locations, as determined at the cease use dates for those facilities, net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained in the future, and will be paid out over the remaining lease terms, the last of which ends in fiscal 2011. We do not expect any significant additional severance or facilities charges related to this plan subsequent to March 31, 2006, other than potential adjustments to lease accruals based on actual subleases differing from estimates. 31 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Exit Activities and Related Costs During the first quarter ended June 30, 2005, we implemented a plan (FY2006 Plan) to reduce costs and realign resources to focus on growth areas. The FY2006 Plan included the involuntary termination of 725 employees. The workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages. The workforce reduction has reduced selling and general and administrative expenses in product areas that are not realizing our profitability and growth goals. We also exited leases in certain locations. We do not expect any significant additional severance or facilities charges related to the FY2006 Plan subsequent to March 31, 2006. The net expense, with adjustments, for fiscal 2006 related to the FY2006 Plan are as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2006 Initial Charge with Adjustments Severance Related Incremental Costs Facilities Depreciation Total (In millions) Cost of license revenues $ 1.2 $ $ $ 1.2 Cost of maintenance revenues 2.8 2.8 Cost of professional services 2.8 2.8 Selling and marketing expenses 24.6 0.2 24.8 Research and development expenses 3.7 3.7 General and administrative expenses 7.5 0.3 0.8 8.6 Total included in operating expenses $ 42.6 $ 0.5 $ 0.8 $ 43.9 As of March 31, 2006, $0.5 million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the FY2006 Plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows: Balance at Charged Effect of Cash Payments, Balance at March 31, to Adjustments Exchange Rate Net of Sublease March 31, 2005 Expense to Estimates Changes Income 2006 (In millions) Severance and related costs $ $ 42.6 $ (0.7 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (41.6 ) $ 0.2 Facilities costs 0.5 (0.2 ) 0.3 Total accrued $ $ 43.1 $ (0.7 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (41.8 ) $ 0.5 Cost of License Revenues Cost of license revenues is primarily comprised of (i) the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed products, (ii) amortization of purchased software included in internally developed products, (iii) amortization of acquired technology for products acquired through business combinations, (iv) license based royalties to third parties and (v) production and distribution costs for initial product licenses. The cost of license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 also include a portion of the severance and facilities costs related to exit activities discussed under Fiscal 2004 Exit Activities and Related Costs and Fiscal 2006 Exit Activities and Related Costs above and in Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost of license revenues was 12.5%, or $177.3 million, 9.3%, or $136.4 million, and 8.3%, or $124.4 million, of total revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The cost of license revenues was 30.7%, 25.0% and 23.6% of license revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and consisted of the following: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Amortization of capitalized software development costs $ 107.5 $ 74.9 $ 71.1 Amortization of acquired technology 47.7 54.4 44.4 Expenses related to exit activities 12.2 (0.8 ) 1.2 Other 9.9 7.9 7.7 $ 177.3 $ 136.4 $ 124.4 The cost of license revenues decreased 23.1%, or $40.9 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to 32 Table of Contents reduced amortization of capitalized software development costs and the impact of the FY2004 Plan in fiscal 2004, partially offset by increased amortization of acquired technology. The reduction in the amortization of capitalized software development costs is primarily due to the $36.8 million increase in fiscal 2004 related to the changes in estimated economic useful lives of certain products as of January 1, 2003 discussed below. The cost of license revenues decreased 8.8%, or $12.0 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily the result of the conclusion of the amortization of acquired technology Remedy as compared to the year earlier period. As discussed under Critical Accounting Policies above, we capitalize software development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86. The following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and amortized during fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006. Amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets. Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Software development costs capitalized $ (53.3 ) $ (61.7 ) $ (56.7 ) Total amortization 107.5 74.9 71.1 Net impact on operating expenses $ 54.2 $ 13.2 $ 14.4 Accelerated amortization included in total amortization above $ 19.1 $ 2.8 $ 0.8 Cost of Maintenance Revenues Beginning in fiscal 2005, we have presented the cost of maintenance revenues separately in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. All periods presented have been reclassified for consistency. The cost of maintenance revenues is primarily comprised of the costs associated with the customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance, enhancement and support services to our customers. The cost of maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 also included a portion of the severance and facilities costs related to exit activities discussed under Fiscal 2004 Exit Activities and Related Costs and Fiscal 2006 Exit Activities and Related Costs above and in Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost of maintenance revenues was 15.0%, or $212.1 million, 12.7%, or $186.0 million, and 11.9%, or $177.6 million, of total revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The cost of maintenance revenues was 28.0%, 22.6% and 20.2% of maintenance revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and consisted of the following: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Cost of maintenance services $ 186.2 $ 182.2 $ 162.1 Expenses related to exit activities 20.5 (1.9 ) 2.8 Other 5.4 5.7 12.7 $ 212.1 $ 186.0 $ 177.6 The cost of maintenance revenues decreased 12.3%, or $26.1 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the expenses related to exit activities in fiscal 2004, as discussed above. The headcount reductions associated with the exit activities were completed during the first half of fiscal 2004 and therefore the cost of maintenance services in the table above reflects the positive impact of these reductions for a portion of fiscal 2004. A full year of benefit was realized in fiscal 2005, which was partially offset by increases in costs for headcount added during the year from expansion into different locations and from acquisitions. The cost of maintenance revenues decreased 4.5%, or $8.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of headcount reductions incurred during fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan and a shift in focus from maintenance to development efforts. Cost of Professional Services Revenues The cost of professional services revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. The cost of professional services revenues was 5.6%, or $79.2 million, 6.3%, or $91.8 million, and 5.8%, or $86.3 million, of total revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The 33 Table of Contents cost of professional services revenues was 93.3%, 99.6% and 93.2% of professional services revenues for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Cost of professional services revenues increased 15.9%, or $12.6 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Excluding the costs related to exit activities in fiscal 2004, the cost of professional services increased 19.5%, or $15.0 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to increased professional services revenues and increased utilization of third party implementation services. Cost of professional services revenues decreased 6.0%, or $5.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to 2006. Excluding the costs related to exit activities in fiscal 2006, the cost of professional services decreased 9.0%, or $8.3 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of lower ongoing personnel costs. Selling and Marketing Our selling and marketing expenses primarily include personnel and related costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, industry trade shows and sales seminars, and represented 43.0%, or $610.2 million, 38.1%, or $557.7 million, and 35.0%, or $524.3 million, of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 8.6%, or $52.5 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Excluding the costs related to exit activities in fiscal 2004, selling and marketing expenses decreased 0.7%, or $4.0 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of decreased commissions expense partially offset by increased headcount and travel costs, including acquisitions. Commission expense was down as a result of changes in our commission plan that led to increased commissions on maintenance transactions which are initially deferred and then are expensed as the related revenues are recognized. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 5.8%, or $32.1 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Excluding the costs related to exit activities in fiscal 2006, selling and marketing expenses decreased 10.5%, or $58.7 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to headcount reductions incurred during fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan. For fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, commission expense was impacted by the changes in our deferred commissions balance (i.e., the net impact of commissions deferred and commissions recognized out of the deferred balance) as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Net impact of change in deferred commissions on selling and marketing expenses $ (9.0 ) $ (44.8 ) $ 8.8 Total deferred commissions balance $ 14.0 $ 58.8 $ 50.0 Research and Development Research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include computer hardware/software costs, telecommunications and personnel expenses necessary to maintain our research and development data processing center. Research and development expenses represented 17.6%, or $249.9 million, 14.7%, or $215.1 million, and 14.2%, or $212.6 million, of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Research and development expenses decreased 13.9%, or $34.8 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the costs related to exit activities in the prior year. Excluding the exit costs in fiscal 2004, research and development costs decreased 2.8%, or $6.2 million. While we had personnel growth in lower cost locations and from acquisitions, research and development expenses declined because more software development costs required capitalization, as discussed under Cost of License Revenues above. Research and development expenses decreased 1.2%, or $2.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Excluding the exit costs in fiscal 2006, research and development costs decreased 2.9%, or $6.3 million, primarily due to headcount reductions incurred during fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management, finance and accounting, IT, facilities management, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for outside legal and accounting services, consulting 34 Table of Contents projects and insurance. General and administrative expenses represented 12.3%, or $174.6 million, 14.6%, or $213.1 million, and 14.1%, or $211.9 million, of total revenues in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased 22.1%, or $38.5 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Excluding the exit costs in fiscal 2004, general and administrative expenses increased 24.9%, or $42.5 million, in fiscal 2005. This increase included higher professional fees, consisting of legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily due to Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance efforts, and higher personnel costs, a significant portion of which related to expanded accounting staff. Total third party fees incurred in fiscal 2005 related to Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance were $19.0 million. The increase for fiscal 2005 also included the write off of $11.4 million of costs capitalized for an internal use information technology project that was terminated before completion during the year and other internal use software assets. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.6%, or $1.2 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Excluding the exit costs in fiscal 2006, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.2%, or $8.9 million, in fiscal 2006 primarily due to the fiscal 2005 $11.4 million write off of capitalized costs discussed previously, partially offset by increased third party operations consulting. Amortization of Intangible Assets Under the purchase accounting method for acquisitions, portions of the purchase prices for our acquisitions were allocated to other intangible assets, including tradenames. Through March 31, 2005, most of our acquired tradenames were not amortized because the assets were deemed to have indefinite remaining useful lives. However, as a result of a re branding campaign, we changed the estimated economic useful lives, effective April 1, 2005, of acquired tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years. The carrying amount of the previously unamortized tradenames at March 31, 2005 was $25.2 million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful life commencing April 1, 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2006, the pre tax and after tax increase in amortization expense resulting from this change in estimate was $13.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, and the reduction to basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.05. Amortization of intangible assets increased 55.6%, or $7.4 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquisitions in prior years. Amortization of intangible assets increased 58.5%, or $12.1 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the aforementioned change in estimate, partially offset by the conclusion of amortization of certain other intangibles. Acquired Research and Development During fiscal 2004 and 2005, we wrote off acquired in process research and development (IPRD) totaling $1.0 million in connection with the acquisition of Magic (2% of the purchase price) and $4.0 million in connection with the acquisitions of Viadyne, Calendra and OpenNetwork (collectively, 7% of the aggregate purchase price), respectively. The amounts allocated to IPRD represent the estimated fair values, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to incomplete research and development projects. At the dates of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates, during fiscal 2004 and 2005. During fiscal 2006, there was no write off of IPRD. In making the purchase price allocations to IPRD, we considered present value calculations of income, analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items, assessments of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes from such projects. A risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the cash flows of each of the products projected income streams for the five years following the acquisition. These discount rates assume that the risk of revenue streams for new technology is higher than that of existing revenue streams. The discount rates used in the present value calculations were generally derived from a weighted average cost of capital, adjusted upward to reflect the additional risks inherent in the development life cycle, including the useful life of the technology, profitability levels of the 35 Table of Contents technology and the uncertainty of technology advances that are known at the transaction date. Product specific risk includes the stages of completion of each product, the complexity of the development work completed to date, the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance. The estimates used in valuing IPRD were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Impairment of Goodwill We test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, after the annual planning process is complete. Primarily due to reduced operating results in fiscal 2005, including the increased use of third party implementation services, the projected profitability and cash flows of the professional services segment were reduced. As a result, the goodwill of $3.7 million assigned to the professional services segment was considered totally impaired during fiscal 2005. The fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach. There were no impairments of goodwill in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2006. Settlement of Litigation We settled our dispute with Nastel Technologies, Inc. during fiscal 2005. The settlement payment of $11.3 million covers all claims involved in this action. Other Income, net Other income, net, consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and finance receivables, rental income on owned facilities, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on capital leases. Other income, net was $69.5 million, $75.0 million and $75.3 million for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Other income, net, increased 7.9%, or $5.5 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an $8.0 million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables as discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by net losses of $1.6 million on marketable securities in fiscal 2005 and a decrease as a result of the non recurring gain on PATROL Storage Manager in the prior year. Other income, net remained constant from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an $8.0 million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables in fiscal 2005 being fully offset by higher interest income generated from higher average investment portfolio balances receiving higher rates. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) We recorded an income tax benefit of $2.6 million in fiscal 2004, an income tax expense of $22.9 million in fiscal 2005 and an income tax expense of $101.8 million in fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rates were 9%, 23% and 50% for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the tax cost of repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the tax effect attributable to our foreign earnings (net of U.S. tax consequences), changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets, benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and non recurring adjustments to our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes. In fiscal 2006, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax expense of approximately $35.5 million related to the repatriation of approximately $708.8 million of qualified earnings under the applicable provisions of the American Jobs creation Act of 2004 (the Act). In fiscal 2005, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax benefit of $26.7 million recorded as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets, as discussed below. The other significant item impacting our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate was an expense of $11.1 million to adjust our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes, withholding taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be understated after a 36 Table of Contents thorough analysis of all of our income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, the most significant item impacting the effective tax rate was the establishment of a valuation allowance of $15.2 million against our deferred tax assets, as discussed below. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates, see Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies and our forecast of future taxable income. In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in our assumptions, plans and estimates may materially impact our income tax expense. We can support a large portion of our net deferred tax asset through the evaluation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets. Our tax planning strategies primarily involve the acceleration of royalty and cost sharing payments under agreements that are currently in place between BMC Software and its foreign affiliates. Under these agreements, the acceleration of such payments is at our sole discretion. Each year we must evaluate the amount of domestic deferred tax assets that could be supported by the acceleration of these taxable income streams. In our evaluation we also considered negative evidence such as our inability to carryback losses to earlier tax years. After a thorough evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance is not required except for certain specific items discussed below and that our net deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2006 is supportable. After a thorough evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence for fiscal 2005, we concluded that a valuation allowance was not necessary beyond certain specific items and that our net deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2005 was supportable. Consistent with this judgment, we recorded a $26.7 million tax benefit as part of the total income tax expense for fiscal 2005, for the reversal of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets. We also reduced our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of $13.8 million for tax benefits attributable to non qualified stock option exercises in prior years that resided in the net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, we evaluated all available positive and negative evidence and concluded that a valuation allowance was required for a portion of our deferred tax asset. SFAS No. 109 also requires the evaluation of the character of income that generated our deferred tax assets and the jurisdictions involved. Our deferred tax assets include losses that are attributable to capital transactions that require future taxable income of a specific character in order to utilize. In fiscal 2005, we maintained a valuation allowance against this specific asset as we did not have positive evidence that supported the utilization of the capital loss. Subsequent to fiscal 2006, we entered into a firm contract to sell the real estate associated with our corporate headquarters in Houston. We expect this sale to generate sufficient capital gain income to offset our current capital loss deferred tax assets. We anticipate that this transaction provides the positive evidence necessary to release the valuation allowance that we had established against the capital loss deferred tax assets. We have also maintained a valuation allowance against a research and development credit acquired as part of the Marimba acquisition due to various uncertainties regarding the utilization of this specific asset. In fiscal 2005, we increased our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to goodwill of $2.7 million related to this acquired asset. If this valuation allowance is reduced in a future year, a related reduction to goodwill would be recognized. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis. See Note 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our deferred tax assets. We provide for the U.S. income tax effect on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. At March 31, 2006, we have a deferred tax asset of $2.8 million related to excess foreign tax credits that are available to offset U.S. income taxes on the earnings that we do not consider indefinitely reinvested under APB Opinion No. 23. As of March 31, 2006, the cumulative earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided were approximately $82.6 million. If these earnings were repatriated to the United States or they were no longer determined to be indefinitely reinvested under APB Opinion No. 23, the potential tax liability for these earnings is approximately $27.6 million, assuming full utilization of the foreign tax credits associated with these earnings. The balance of indefinitely reinvested earnings as of fiscal 2005 was $770.0 million. The balance of $82.6 million as of fiscal 2006 is substantially lower due to the repatriation of the majority of our indefinitely reinvested earnings under the Act. 37 Table of Contents The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was enacted on October 24, 2004, and provides for a special one time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. In June 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately $717 million of foreign earnings. During fiscal 2006, we executed this plan and repatriated $708.8 million of foreign earnings and recorded a federal and state tax expense of $35.5 million associated with these repatriated earnings. As of March 31, 2006, we have foreign tax credit carryforwards of $16.0 million that will expire between 2012 and 2014 and research and development tax credit carryforwards of $5.7 million (net of a $2.7 million valuation allowance) that will expire in 2020 and 2021. We also have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $0.4 million that are not subject to expiration. We have state net operating losses carryforwards of $42.4 million and foreign net operating losses of $0.4 million which expire between 2009 and 2023 that we believe we will be able to utilize. In addition, there are other state and foreign net operating losses that we do not believe will be utilized and therefore we have not recorded a deferred tax asset related to these losses. The IRS has completed its examination of our federal income tax returns filed for the tax years ended March 31, 2002 and 2003 and issued its Revenue Agent Report (RAR) on December 15, 2005. We have filed our protest letter contesting the adjustments included in the RAR with the IRS Appeals Division (Appeals office) and expects to start discussions with the Appeals office in July 2006. We cannot predict the ultimate resolution date of these negotiations with the Appeals office. We are also currently working with the Appeals office to resolve the issues raised at examination related to our federal income tax returns filed for the tax years ended March 31, 2000 and 2001. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments raised in each examination, that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made and, therefore, that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. October 28, 2005, the Israeli Tax Authorities (ITA) issued Determination of Assessments (Assessments) to various Israeli affiliates of the Company that covered the 1998 2002 tax years. The Israeli affiliates filed protests of the Assessments with the ITA on December 15, 2005 and have requested a hearing to pursue resolution of these Assessments with the ITA. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments raised in these Assessments, that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made, and therefore, that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. On December 7, 2005, we filed a writ of mandamus in Brazil in order to clarify whether or not a tax applies to the remittance of software payments from our Brazilian operations. In response to the filing, the first level Court denied our request for preliminary injunction, but the merits of the case have not been analyzed. We anticipate we will prevail in this matter and intends to continue to pursue a favorable outcome. We do not expect a resolution in the near future. The Companys income tax provision includes amounts that are intended to cover taxes that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, including amounts associated with the RARs and the Assessments. The actual resolution of these income tax audits could lead to an income tax liability that is materially different from the amounts that have been provided. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF Issue No. 03 1 provides guidance on evaluating other than temporary impairment for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, as well as non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method. The consensus includes a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF Issue 03 1 1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF Issue No. 03 1 until the FASB staff provided applicable implementation guidance. This delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature. During the period of delay, an entity holding investments must continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2005, the FASB issued a proposed Staff Position (FSP), FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application of Certain Investments (FSP FAS 115 1). This FSP replaces the guidance set forth in paragraphs 10 through 18 of EITF 03 1 with references to existing other than 38 Table of Contents temporary impairment guidance, such as SFAS No. 115. FSP FAS 115 1 clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made. FSP FAS 115 1 is effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after September 15, 2005. There was no new implementation guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads in the final FSP. BMC has incorporated the guidance of FSP FAS 115 1 with the guidance of EITF 03 1 and FAS 115 effective December 2005 in assessing impairment of its marketable securities. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In April 2005, the SEC issued a rule delaying the required adoption date for SFAS No. 123(R) to the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) permits adoption using one of two methods: (1) a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or (2) a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method, but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method as of April 1, 2006, the beginning of our fiscal 2007. We are currently evaluating option valuation assumptions under the Black Scholes model in light of FAS 123(R) and the SEC guidance; the assumptions we ultimately use to adopt FAS 123(R) may be different than those currently used as discussed in Note 1(l) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, through March 31, 2006, we accounted for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options, as the exercise prices of options granted are generally equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited circumstances when stock options have been exchanged in a business combination. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in Note 1(l) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. In general, this requirement would reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the excess tax deductions recorded in fiscal 2005 were $17.3 million and 2006 was $9.9 million. We did not recognize any such tax benefits for fiscal 2004. In December 2005, the FSB released Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax effects of Share based Payment Awards, which provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees. The Company is currently reviewing the transition alternatives and will elect the appropriate alternative within one year of the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Liquidity and Capital Resources One of our major goals is to optimize our capital structure. The key metrics we focus on in analyzing the strength of our financial position are summarized in the tables below: 39 Table of Contents Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 498.7 $ 501.9 $ 420.9 Treasury stock acquired 170.1 87.0 411.0 Cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired 53.8 266.1 9.4 As of March 31, 2005 2006 (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,283.1 $ 1,343.7 Trade accounts receivable, net (including current finance receivables) 354.2 291.0 Long term trade finance receivables, net 126.1 81.9 Deferred revenue 1,642.9 1,628.3 Operating Activities The table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from operating activities: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Net earnings (loss) $ (26.8 ) $ 75.3 $ 102.0 Adjustments to net earnings (loss) for items whose cash effects are investing or financing cash flows 266.6 227.8 207.7 Decrease in accounts receivable and finance receivables 23.1 55.0 107.1 Increase (Decrease) in current and long term deferred revenue 222.9 223.8 (14.9 ) Changes in all other operating assets and liabilities, net 12.9 (80.0 ) 19.0 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 498.7 $ 501.9 $ 420.9 The most significant component of Adjustments to net earnings (loss) for items whose cash effects are investing or financing cash flows is depreciation and amortization, as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Depreciation $ 87.8 $ 69.5 $ 57.9 Amortization of capitalized software development costs 107.5 74.9 71.1 Amortization of acquired technology 47.7 54.4 44.4 Amortization of intangible assets 13.3 20.7 32.8 Amortization of premiums (discounts) on marketable debt securities 3.1 2.2 (1.1 ) Depreciation and amortization $ 259.4 $ 221.7 $ 205.1 The most significant component of the changes in all other operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2005 was related to cash paid for exit costs of $26.1 million, net of sublease income received, primarily related to exited leases as discussed under Fiscal 2004 Exit Activities and Related Costs above and a litigation settlement of $11.3 million to Nastel, as discussed under Settlement of Litigation above. For fiscal 2006, the decrease in accounts receivables and finance receivables is primarily due to reduced transactions in fiscal 2006. For all periods presented, the change in deferred revenues does not impact total operating cash flows as the offset is in earnings. During fiscal 2006, we paid cash exit costs of $56.0 million and paid $56.0 million in taxes. We continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations. Our primary source of 40 Table of Contents cash is the sale of our software licenses, software maintenance and professional services. We expect that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. If we were to make a significant acquisition in the future, we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source (i.e., cash held in the United States of America versus international locations), the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital. Investing Activities The table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from investing activities: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired $ (53.8 ) $ (266.1 ) $ (9.4 ) Proceeds from maturities/sales of marketable securities 229.3 330.5 315.9 Purchases of marketable securities (322.3 ) (190.9 ) (291.8 ) Capitalization of software development costs (53.3 ) (61.7 ) (56.7 ) All other, net (48.3 ) (46.4 ) (18.0 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (248.4 ) $ (234.6 ) $ (60.0 ) During fiscal 2004, we acquired Magic and made contractual adjustments to the purchase prices for the fiscal 2003 acquisitions. In fiscal 2005, we acquired Marimba, Calendra, and OpenNetwork. In fiscal 2006, we acquired KMXperts Inc. Our acquisitions are discussed in more detail under Acquisitions above and in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The main component of other cash used in investing activities was purchases of property and equipment, which were primarily purchases of computer hardware and software in all years. In fiscal 2004, as a result of office relocations during that year, leasehold improvements were a factor.. Financing Activities The table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from financing activities: Years Ended March 31, 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Payments on capital leases $ (3.2 ) $ (5.1 ) $ (7.1 ) Treasury stock acquired (170.1 ) (87.0 ) (411.0 ) Stock options exercised and other, net 29.6 28.4 140.0 Net cash used in financing activities $ (143.7 ) $ (63.7 ) $ (278.1 ) There were no borrowings during fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 and the main use of cash for financing activities was the acquisition of treasury stock in all years. During fiscal 2005 and 2006, approximately 5.3 million and 20.5 million, respectively, shares of treasury stock were purchased. We plan to increase our treasury stock purchases, subject to market conditions, other possible uses of our cash and our domestic liquidity position. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The exercise of stock options was the primary source of cash from financing activities. During fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, there were 1.8 million, 2.1 million and 8.6 million options exercised, respectively. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities At March 31, 2006, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.3 billion, an increase of $60.6 million from the March 31, 2005 balance. As discussed in more detail below, this increase is primarily the 41 Table of Contents result of cash flow generated from operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options during fiscal 2006, partially offset by treasury stock purchases, purchases of property and equipment and software development costs. Approximately 38% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2006 was held in international locations and was largely generated from our international operations. Our international operations have generated approximately $82.6 million of earnings for which U.S. income taxes have not been recorded. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if repatriated to the United States. The potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $27.6 million; however, we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the $82.6 million as we plan to utilize our cash in international locations for foreign investment purposes. During fiscal 2004 and 2005, we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the Magic and Calendra purchase prices. In June 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately $717 million of foreign earnings to take advantage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. During fiscal 2006, we executed this plan and repatriated $708.8 million of qualified earnings under the Act. We recorded an income tax provision of $35.5 million associated with these earnings. Our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid. A significant dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year, and while typically yielding greater returns, investing in such securities reduces reported working capital. Finance Receivables We provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables, enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk. The finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, we transferred $288.7 million, $247.4 million and $160.9 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. The high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis. However, to meet the needs of our customers we have been providing more licensing options, and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more customer transactions where cash payments will be received over time. This flexibility may also reduce our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future and may reduce our cash flow from operations in the near term. As discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, prior to fiscal 2004, we securitized trade finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two commercial paper conduit entities sponsored by third party financial institutions. In April 2004, one of these third party entities sold its interests in our outstanding securitized finance receivables to the other third party entity, such that the senior interests in all of our outstanding securitized finance receivables were held by one entity. In December 2004, we purchased the senior interests from this entity at fair value, effectively terminating our securitization arrangements. We simultaneously transferred the outstanding finance receivables that had previously been securitized to an unaffiliated financial institution on a non recourse basis through our existing financial subsidiary. This transfer was recorded as a sale in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Treasury Stock Purchased Our Board of Directors has authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program ($500.0 million authorized in April 2000, $500.0 million in July 2002 and $1.0 billion in November 2005). During fiscal 2006, we purchased 20.5 million shares for $411.0 million. From the inception of the repurchase plan through March 31, 2006, we have purchased 65.1 million shares for $1,190.6 million. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The repurchase program will continue to be funded primarily with cash generated from operations. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2006: Payments due by Period Less Than After 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Capital lease obligations $ 7.0 $ 9.6 $ $ $ 16.6 Operating lease obligations 59.8 97.7 45.5 58.1 261.1 Purchase obligations (1) 2.7 1.5 4.2 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 1.5 2.9 2.7 7.1 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 71.0 $ 111.7 $ 48.2 $ 58.1 $ 289.0 (1) Represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchase goods or services.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non U.S. enterprises is the local currency. For fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, approximately 48.4%, or $686.1 million, 48.1%, or $704.0 million, and 47.0%, or $703.6 million, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States, substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies. Similarly, substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies. As a result, our U.S. dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk: forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month. Forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts, with terms generally less than one year, are used to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, transactions. Principal currencies hedged are the euro and British pound in Europe, the Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the Asia Pacific region and the Israeli shekel. While we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2006, we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of $0.7 million based on a value at risk (VAR) model utilizing Monte Carlo simulation. The comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2005 was $1.9 million utilizing the same model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The average VAR for the period was 43 Table of Contents $1.4 million for fiscal 2006 and $2.2 million for fiscal 2005. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. Interest Rate Risk Investments We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $1.3 billion at March 31, 2006, and the marketable securities of $437.8 million primarily represented different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. Based on our consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2006 and our consolidated results of operations and net cash flows for fiscal 2006, we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows. We used a VAR variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
