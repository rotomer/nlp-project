ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MDA) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. 19 Table of Contents Overview During fiscal 2007, we continued to significantly improve our performance as we focused on enhancing our leadership in Business Service Management (BSM), strengthening our mainframe business, and increasing operating efficiency. Toward these ends, we resegmented our software operations into two software business segments Enterprise Service Management (ESM) and Mainframe Service Management (MSM). We believe this resegmentation will enable us to optimize how we build value and provide greater clarity, accountability and focus for our business operations. While there are key technology and sales synergies which span both software business segments, the new structure enables us to more effectively manage to the different dynamics that drive the market in each segment. Our third business segment, Professional Services, also continues to be an integral part of our strategy. Underlying our solid performance in fiscal 2007 is our success in capturing the growing demand for our BSM solutions. This demand is being driven by key industry trends. First, information technology (IT) budgets, which consist of hardware, software, network and IT labor costs, are under constant scrutiny. IT labor costs, which are a large component of IT spending, are an area of particular focus. Companies are increasingly realizing that our BSM solutions enable them to increase productivity and efficiency and save money by automating their IT processes and improve how IT shapes, responds and reacts to business decisions and challenges. To capture opportunities in the market, we continue to enhance our technology leadership in BSM. We have developed the only second generation, completely federated configuration management database or CMDB. It is an essential first step for implementing BSM. The BMC Atrium CMDB is the only all in one integrated, federated solution. We also continue to introduce new offerings that broaden and deepen our BSM solutions portfolio, and to expand the alliances and partnerships we have with systems integrators and other vendors. Our MSM business also contributed to our improved performance during fiscal 2007. While the underlying market for mainframes is mature, mainframes remain important to our larger enterprise customers because of their stability, reliability and improvements to total cost of ownership. Our focus is on enhancing our MSM portfolio and integrating it into our BSM strategy and architecture in order to increase our market share, stabilize revenue, and improve earnings. During fiscal 2007, as part of our on going focus to improve our operating efficiencies, we took further action to simplify, standardize and automate our key business processes. In connection with these actions, we recorded a $44.6 million charge that related principally to workforce reductions. We believe there will be additional opportunities to realize operating efficiencies in future periods. During fiscal 2007, we continued to experience an increase in the number and magnitude of license transactions that require ratable recognition of license revenue over the term of the agreement, due to an increase in time based license agreements and an increase in customer transactions containing other terms and conditions that preclude upfront license revenue recognition. In addition to executing time based license agreements, the primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include but are not limited to customer arrangements that include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, customer arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights, customer arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering and other contractual terms and conditions that require ratable revenue recognition over the term of the arrangements. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. 20 Table of Contents We continued our commitment to enhance shareholder value by significantly increasing the cash returned to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 20.7 million shares for a total value of $555.0 million. It is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term and that we plan a portion of our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenue. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter and, therefore, we generally do not know whether revenue has met our expectations until after the end of the quarter. If a shortfall in revenue were to occur in any given quarter, there would be an immediate, and possibly significant, impact to our overall earnings and, most likely, our stock price. Industry Conditions In recent years, growth in the global IT market has recovered to a rate roughly twice that of the overall economy. Software spending continues to grow faster than the overall IT market, with the highest growth projected to occur in emerging markets such as Latin America, Asia Pacific and eastern Europe. Within the software market, the markets for our MSM products are forecast to show slight growth, while the ESM markets should continue to grow faster than the overall software market. However, IT organizations continue to be pressured by their business counterparts to lower overall operational costs while increasing support for regulatory compliance, strategic objectives and other projects focused on delivering increased value to the business. The demands placed on customers IT organizations have resulted in increased pricing pressures on technology vendors. We believe that BSM helps IT organizations succeed in todays business environment and differentiates us from our competitors. We recognize that the systems management software market place remains highly competitive in both of our software business segments, ESM and MSM. In the ESM segment, we compete with a variety of software vendors, including large vendors such as IBM, HP and CA, as well as a number of smaller software vendors. We compete for new customers and, from time to time, must compete to maintain our relationships with our current customers. In the MSM segment, we compete primarily with IBM and CA. The mainframe management software market is more mature and we must compete to maintain our relationships with our current customers while competing to displace our competitors products and win new customers. This competition can lead to pricing pressure and can affect our margins. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, acquired technology, in process research and development, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets, and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of maintenance through independent maintenance renewals, which demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand alone basis. 21 Table of Contents We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in arrangements that include software products for which maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value can be established, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term in the arrangement. In our time based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms, and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license fees in time based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years. Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and training services associated with our products, is derived under both time and material and fixed fee arrangements and in most instances is recognized on a proportional performance basis. If no discernable customer deliverable exists until the completion of the professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of professional services revenue until completion of the services. Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not involve significant production, modification, or customization of our software products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method. We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators (collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our products and services. In license arrangements with channel partners, title and risk of loss pass to the channel partners upon execution of our arrangements with them and the delivery of our products to the channel partner. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. Capitalized Software Development Costs Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until the products general release to customers in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86). Capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the products estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. We evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value, as defined by SFAS No. 86, requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenue as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs. 22 Table of Contents Acquired Technology, In Process Research and Development, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values are estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach, which requires us to project the related future revenue and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. Once the acquired assets are recorded, we amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives. All goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value. When conducting impairment assessments, we are required to estimate future cash flows. The estimates used in valuing all intangible assets, including in process research and development, are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives. Incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in future impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Valuation of Investments Our investments primarily consist of marketable debt and equity securities. We account for our marketable investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We regularly analyze our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment. This analysis requires significant judgment. The primary factors considered when determining if an impairment charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is other than temporary include whether: (i) the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis; (ii) the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated; (iii) if a debt security, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security; (iv) the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time; (v) if a debt security, such security has been downgraded by a rating agency; and (vi) we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities. However, from time to time, issuer specific and market specific events could warrant an impairment write down. As the vast majority of our marketable securities are investment grade debt securities, we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Marketable securities with a fair value below our cost as of March 31, 2007 is discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for the effect of income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current years results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. We are required to make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine (i) our income tax expense or benefit, (ii) our deferred tax assets and liabilities and (iii) whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic (including state) and foreign authorities. These factors significantly impact the amounts we record related to income taxes. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets take into account positive and negative evidence about possible sources of taxable income available under the tax laws to realize the tax benefit, including projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and the amounts that may be realized utilizing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of taxable income in future years could differ from our estimates and the related impact on our income tax expense or benefit could materially affect our consolidated results of operations. 23 Table of Contents We are subject to corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires significant judgments and estimates. We evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5) and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of SFAS No. 5. We also have various domestic and foreign income tax exposures that do not meet the probable and or estimable criteria of SFAS No. 5 and therefore no tax expense has been accrued. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these exposures could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. Acquisitions In May 2006, we acquired Identify Software Ltd. for $150.0 million in cash. This acquisition provides additional solutions to our transaction management strategy, which provides customers with enhanced application and problem resolution capabilities, enabling them to pinpoint the cause of transaction breakdowns. In January 2005, we acquired Calendra for $34.0 million in cash, and in March 2005, we acquired the assets of OpenNetwork for cash of $18.4 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of OpenNetwork. These two acquisitions completed our transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a complete suite provider. The combination of our CONTROL SA provisioning solution with Calendras state of the art business process centric workflow and directory management capabilities, eliminated integration issues typically faced by customers purchasing individual components from multiple vendors. The OpenNetwork acquisition expanded our Identity Management product suite to include browser based authentication and authorization solutions that enable customers to securely manage access to Web based applications across multiple business environments. In July 2004, we acquired Marimba for $230.3 million in cash plus stock options valued at $20.9 million. This acquisition provided new and extended capabilities to our BSM offerings in the areas of change and configuration management, security management and infrastructure management, enabling our customers to rapidly respond to changing business requirements by re purposing, re provisioning and updating IT resources to achieve required IT configurations. These transactions, along with various other less significant technology acquisitions, have been accounted for using the purchase accounting method, and accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. Historical Information Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating results, see Risk Factors above. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the percentages that selected items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations bear to total revenue.

All prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this new structure and conform with our internal reorganization into already defined Enterprise Service Management and Mainframe Service Management operating segments. Software License Revenue Percentage Change 2007 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) Enterprise Service Management $ 330.1 $ 284.5 $ 291.6 16.0 % (2.4 )% Mainframe Service Management 239.7 242.5 254.9 (1.2 )% (4.9 )% Total software license revenue $ 569.8 $ 527.0 $ 546.5 8.1 % (3.6 )% Software Maintenance Revenue Percentage Change 2007 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) Enterprise Service Management $ 480.1 $ 450.7 $ 419.6 6.5 % 7.4 % Mainframe Service Management 438.7 428.1 404.7 2.5 % 5.8 % Total software maintenance revenue $ 918.8 $ 878.8 $ 824.3 4.6 % 6.6 % Total Software Revenue Percentage Change 2007 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) Enterprise Service Management $ 810.2 $ 735.2 $ 711.2 10.2 % 3.4 % Mainframe Service Management 678.4 670.6 659.6 1.2 % 1.7 % Total software revenue $ 1,488.6 $ 1,405.8 $ 1,370.8 5.9 % 2.6 % Software License Revenue Total software license revenue was $569.8 million, $527.0 million and $546.5 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in total software license revenue of 8.1%, or $42.8 million, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable to license revenue increases in the ESM segment, partially offset by a slight decline in license revenue in the MSM segment, as discussed below. Of the license transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront decreased from 59% during fiscal 2006 to 51% during fiscal 2007. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $38.5 million for fiscal 2007, as compared to the prior year period. During fiscal 2007, we closed 89 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $243.1 million, compared with 66 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $165.3 million, in fiscal 2006. The decrease in total software license revenue of 3.6%, or $19.5 million, in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was attributable to license revenue decreases in both the ESM and MSM segments, as discussed below. Of the license transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront decreased from 63% during fiscal 2005 to 59% during fiscal 2006. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $48.5 million for fiscal 2006, as compared to the prior year period. During fiscal 2006, we closed 66 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $165.3 million, compared with 86 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $237.7 million, in fiscal 2005. 26 Table of Contents ESM license revenue represented 57.9%, or $330.1 million, 54.0%, or $284.5 million, and 53.4%, or $291.6 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. ESM license revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 16.0%, or $45.6 million, from fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased demand for our ESM products, principally our BSM solutions, including incremental license revenue resulting from our acquisition of Identify Software in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as well as an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue period over period, partially offset by an increase in the level of new license transactions whose revenue are being deferred into future periods. ESM license revenue for fiscal 2006 decreased 2.4%, or $7.1 million, from fiscal 2005, primarily due to a decrease in license transactions year over year resulting from competitive pressures in the markets we serve. MSM license revenue represented 42.1%, or $239.7 million, 46.0%, or $242.5 million, and 46.6%, or $254.9 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2007 remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2006, decreasing 1.2%, or $2.8 million. This fiscal 2007 decrease was attributable primarily to an increase in the level of new license transactions whose revenue are being deferred into future periods, partially offset by a higher volume of license transactions executed and an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue period over period. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2006 decreased 4.9%, or $12.4 million, from fiscal 2005, primarily due to a decrease in license transactions executed period over period, partially offset by an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue period over period. The historical decreases in MSM license revenue are indicative of a mature and highly competitive market. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our recognized license revenue was impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Deferrals of license revenue $ (314.8 ) $ (229.3 ) $ (226.1 ) Recognition from deferred license revenue 242.7 204.2 155.7 Net impact on recognized license revenue $ (72.1 ) $ (25.1 ) $ (70.4 ) Deferred license revenue balance at end of year $ 504.4 $ 432.3 $ 407.2 The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include: customer transactions that contain certain complex contractual terms and conditions, customer transactions which include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements which include unlimited licensing rights, time based licenses which are recognized over the term of the arrangement, customer transactions which include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the maintenance and or professional services. All of these instances cause the license revenue to be deferred. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. 27 Table of Contents Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. As of March 31, 2007, the deferred license revenue balance was $504.4 million and had an estimated remaining life of approximately three years. As additional license revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred license revenue we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2007 follows (in millions): Fiscal 2008 $ 238.9 Fiscal 2009 $ 135.0 Fiscal 2010 and thereafter $ 130.5 Software Maintenance Revenue Total software maintenance revenue was $918.8 million, $878.8 million and $824.3 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total software maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 4.6%, or $40.0 million, from fiscal 2006. Total software maintenance revenue for fiscal 2006 increased 6.6%, or $54.5 million, from fiscal 2005. These increases were attributable to increases in both ESM and MSM maintenance revenue, as discussed below. ESM maintenance revenue represented 52.3%, or $480.1 million, 51.3%, or $450.7 million, and 50.9%, or $419.6 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. ESM maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 6.5%, or $29.4 million, as compared to fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 increased 7.4%, or $31.1 million, as compared to fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2007 and 2006 increases were attributable to the growth in our installed ESM customer license base, including additional maintenance revenue in fiscal 2007 resulting from our acquisition of Identify Software in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. MSM maintenance revenue represented 47.7%, or $438.7 million, 48.7%, or $428.1 million, and 49.1%, or $404.7 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. MSM maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 2.5%, or $10.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 increased 5.8%, or $23.4 million, as compared to fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2007 and 2006 increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our customer license base. As of March 31, 2007, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,202.4 million. As new customers are added and or current contracts are renewed and additional maintenance revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred maintenance revenue we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2007 follows (in millions): Fiscal 2008 $ 610.6 Fiscal 2009 $ 326.8 Fiscal 2010 thereafter $ 265.0 28 Table of Contents Domestic vs. International Revenue Percentage Change 2007 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) License: Domestic $ 279.5 $ 263.2 $ 256.2 6.2 % 2.7 % International 290.3 263.8 290.3 10.0 % (9.1 )% Total license revenue 569.8 527.0 546.5 8.1 % (3.6 )% Maintenance: Domestic 507.4 490.0 462.6 3.6 % 5.9 % International 411.4 388.8 361.7 5.8 % 7.5 % Total maintenance revenue 918.8 878.8 824.3 4.6 % 6.6 % Professional services: Domestic 36.6 41.2 40.2 (11.2 )% 2.5 % International 55.2 51.4 52.0 7.4 % (1.2 )% Total professional services revenue 91.8 92.6 92.2 (0.9 )% 0.4 % Total revenue $ 1,580.4 $ 1,498.4 $ 1,463.0 5.5 % 2.4 % License Revenue Our domestic operations generated 49.1% or $279.5 million, 49.9%, or $263.2 million, and 46.9%, or $256.2 million, of license revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Domestic license revenue increased 6.2%, or $16.3 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, and increased 2.7%, or $7.0 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The increase in domestic license revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable primarily to an increase in ESM license revenue resulting from increased demand for our ESM products, principally our BSM solutions, and incremental revenue associated with our acquisition of Identify Software. The increase in domestic license revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was attributable primarily to an increase in MSM license revenue. International license revenue represented 50.9%, or $290.3 million, 50.1%, or $263.8 million, and 53.1%, or $290.3 million, of license revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. International license revenue increased 10.0%, or $26.5 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in ESM license revenue in our European and Asia Pacific markets resulting from increased demand for our ESM products, principally our BSM solutions, and incremental revenue associated with our acquisition of Identify Software. International license revenue decreased 9.1%, or $26.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, due to decreases in both ESM and MSM license revenue primarily in our European and Asia Pacific markets. Maintenance Revenue Our domestic operations generated 55.2%, or $507.4 million, 55.8%, or $490.0 million, and 56.1%, or $462.6 million, of maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 3.6%, or $17.4 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in ESM maintenance revenue resulting from growth in our installed ESM customer license base, including incremental maintenance revenue associated with our acquisition of Identify Software. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 5.9%, or $27.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in both MSM and ESM maintenance revenue resulting from growth in our installed customer base. Our international operations generated 44.8%, or $411.4 million, 44.2%, or $388.8 million, and 43.9%, or $361.7 million, of maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. International maintenance revenue increased 5.8%, or $22.6 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, and increased 7.5%, or $27.1 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The year over year increases were attributable to increases in both MSM and ESM maintenance revenue resulting from growth in our installed customer base, principally in our European market. 29 Table of Contents Foreign currency exchange rate changes, including the impact of hedging, resulted in a favorable impact to the growth in international license revenue of 3.0%, or $7.9 million, from fiscal 2006 to 2007 and an unfavorable impact to the growth in international license revenue of 0.3%, or $0.9 million, from fiscal 2005 to 2006. Professional Services Revenue Professional services revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, decreasing by 0.9%, or $0.8 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, and increasing by 0.4%, or $0.4 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The decrease in fiscal 2007 professional services revenue as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable to an 11.2%, or $4.6 million, decrease in domestic professional services revenue, offset by a 7.4%, or $3.8 million, increase in international professional services revenue. The increase in fiscal 2006 professional services revenue as compared to fiscal 2005 was attributable to a 2.5%, or $1.0 million, increase in domestic professional services revenue, offset by a $1.2%, or $0.6 million, decrease in international professional services revenue. Operating Expenses Percentage Change 2007 2006 Years Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 (In millions) Cost of license revenue $ 99.4 $ 123.3 $ 137.4 (19.4 )% (10.3 )% Cost of maintenance revenue 175.1 175.0 187.6 0.1 % (6.7 )% Cost of professional services revenue 95.8 83.5 91.8 14.7 % (9.0 )% Selling and marketing 518.1 501.6 556.3 3.3 % (9.8 )% Research and development 210.7 209.1 217.4 0.8 % (3.8 )% General and administrative 202.8 203.6 213.1 (0.4 )% (4.5 )% Amortization of intangible assets 26.6 32.8 20.7 (18.9 )% 58.5 % Severance, exit costs and related charges 44.6 41.0 (3.5 ) 8.8 % * In process research and development 4.0 * * Impairment of goodwill 3.7 * * Settlement of litigation 11.3 * * Total operating expenses $ 1,373.1 $ 1,369.9 $ 1,439.8 0.2 % (4.9 )% * not meaningful Cost of License Revenue Cost of license revenue is primarily comprised of (i) the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed products, (ii) amortization of acquired technology for products acquired through business combinations, (iii) license based royalties to third parties and (iv) production and distribution costs for initial product licenses. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, cost of license revenue represented 6.3%, or $99.4 million, 8.2%, or $123.3 million, and 9.4%, or $137.4 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 17.4%, 23.4% and 25.1% of license revenue, respectively. Cost of license revenue decreased 19.4%, or $23.9 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the conclusion of the amortization of certain acquired technologies and a reduction in the amortization of capitalized software development costs, partially offset by the amortization of acquired technology related to Identify Software. Cost of license revenue decreased 10.3%, or $14.1 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the conclusion of the amortization of certain acquired technologies. 30 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the amounts of software development costs capitalized and amortized during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenue to realize the carrying value of the assets. Years Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Software development costs capitalized $ (55.4 ) $ (56.7 ) $ (61.7 ) Total amortization 64.2 71.1 74.9 Net impact on operating expenses $ 8.8 $ 14.4 $ 13.2 Accelerated amortization included in total amortization above $ 1.1 $ 0.8 $ 2.8 Cost of Maintenance Revenue The cost of maintenance revenue is primarily comprised of the costs associated with the customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance and support services to our customers. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, cost of maintenance revenue represented 11.1%, or $175.1 million, 11.7%, or $175.0 million, and 12.8%, or $187.6 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 19.1%, 19.9% and 22.8% of maintenance revenue, respectively. Cost of maintenance revenue remained flat from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased 6.7%, or $12.6 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to headcount reductions incurred during fiscal 2006 relating to restructuring and process improvement initiatives. Cost of Professional Services Revenue Cost of professional services revenue primarily include salaries and related personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, cost of professional services revenue represented 6.1%, or $95.8 million, 5.6%, or $83.5 million, and 6.3%, or $91.8 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 104.4%, 90.2% and 99.6% of professional services revenue, respectively. Cost of professional services revenue increased 14.7%, or $12.3 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an increase in professional service enablement personnel due to increased customer demand for BSM services and an increase in third party consulting fees. Cost of professional services revenue decreased 9.0%, or $8.3 million, from fiscal 2005 to 2006, primarily due to a reduction in professional services personnel. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and related personnel costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, industry trade shows and sales seminars. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, selling and marketing expenses represented 32.8%, or $518.1 million, 33.5%, or $501.6 million, and 38.0%, or $556.3 million, of total revenue, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased 3.3%, or $16.5 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the addition of share based compensation and an increase in travel and marketing campaign expenditures. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 9.8%, or $54.7 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a decrease in personnel and related costs associated with a reduction in sales and marketing personnel. Research and Development Research and development expenses primarily include salaries and related personnel costs of software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include computer hardware/software costs, telecommunications and personnel expenses necessary to maintain our research and development data processing center. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, research and development expenses represented 13.3%, or $210.7 million, 14.0%, or $209.1 million, and 14.9%, or $217.4 million, of total revenue, respectively. Research and development expenses increased 0.8%, or $1.6 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to additional share based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in personnel and related costs associated with a reduction in research and development personnel. Research and development expenses decreased 3.8%, or $8.3 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a decrease in personnel and related costs associated with a reduction in research and development personnel. 31 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and related personnel costs of executive management, finance and accounting, IT, facilities management, legal and human resources personnel. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses include fees paid for outside legal and accounting services, consulting projects and insurance. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, general and administrative expenses represented 12.8%, or $202.8 million, 13.6%, or $203.6 million, and 14.6%, or $213.1 million, of total revenue, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4%, or $0.8 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to lower professional consultant fees associated with our Sarbanes Oxley section 404 compliance efforts and a decrease in employee separation charges and other personnel related cost including travel and recruitment, partially offset by additional share based compensation. General and administrative expenses decreased 4.5%, or $9.5 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the fiscal 2005 write off of $11.4 million in capitalized costs associated with an internal use information technology project that was terminated before completion and other internal use software, partially offset by increased third party consulting expenditures during fiscal 2006. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets consists principally of the amortization of finite lived customer relationship and tradename intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 18.9%, or $6.2 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to conclusion of amortization of certain intangibles at the end of fiscal 2006, partially offset by incremental amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Identify Software in May 2006. Amortization of intangible assets increased 58.5%, or $12.1 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a change in the estimated economic useful lives of certain previously acquired tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years, partially offset by the conclusion of amortization of certain other intangibles. Severance, Exit Costs and Related Charges We have undertaken various restructuring and process improvement initiatives in recent years to reduce costs through the realignment of resources to focus on growth areas and simplification, standardization and automation of key business processes. As a result of these initiatives, we involuntarily terminated approximately 800 and 700 employees during fiscal 2004 and 2006, respectively, and identified for termination approximately 700 employees during fiscal 2007. These workforce reductions are across all functions and geographies and affected employees were, or will be, provided cash separation packages. The workforce reductions have reduced selling and research and development expenses in product areas that were not realizing our profitability and growth goals, as well as general and administrative expenses. Additionally, during these same periods we exited leases in certain locations, reduced the square footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities. The process improvement initiatives started in fiscal 2007 will continue through fiscal 2008. By the end of fiscal 2008, we estimate that the restructuring and process improvement initiatives undertaken during fiscal 2007, as well as those expected to be undertaken during fiscal 2008, will result in an annual savings of $55 to $65 million compared to fiscal 2007 expense levels. In Process Research and Development During fiscal 2005, we wrote off acquired in process research and development (IPRD) totaling $4.0 million in connection with the acquisitions of Viadyne, Calendra and OpenNetwork. The amounts allocated to IPRD represent the estimated fair values, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to incomplete research and development projects. At the dates of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates. There were no write offs of IPRD in connection with our business acquisitions during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. In making the purchase price allocations to IPRD, we considered present value calculations of income, analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items, assessments of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The values assigned to in process research and development were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes from such projects. A risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the cash flows of each of the products projected income streams. These discount rates assume that the risk of revenue streams for new technology is higher than that of existing revenue streams. The discount rates used in the present value calculations were generally derived from a weighted average cost of capital, adjusted upward to reflect the additional risks inherent in the development life cycle, including the useful life of the technology, profitability levels of the technology and the uncertainty of technology advances that are known at the transaction date. Product specific risk includes the stages of completion of each product, the complexity of the development work completed to date, the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance. 32 Table of Contents The estimates used in valuing IPRD were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Impairment of Goodwill We test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, after the annual planning process is substantially complete. In connection with our fiscal 2005 analysis, we determined that revised future profitability and cash flow projections associated with our professional services segment were insufficient to support the carrying value of this reporting unit, principally as a result of reduced operating margins in fiscal 2005 which were in part attributable to the increased use of third party implementation services. As a result, goodwill of $3.7 million assigned to the professional services segment was determined to be fully impaired during fiscal 2005. The fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows by application of the income approach. There were no impairments of goodwill in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Settlement of Litigation During fiscal 2005, we settled a previous dispute with Nastel Technologies, Inc. for $11.3 million. Other Income, net Other income, net, consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and finance receivables that have not been transferred to third parties, rental income on owned facilities, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on capital leases. Other income, net was $93.3 million, $75.3 million and $75.0 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other income, net, increased 23.9%, or $18.0 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to realized gains on investments, higher interest income generated from higher average investment portfolio balances earning higher yields and the impact of certain derivative instruments not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. This was partially offset by a reduction in lease income resulting from the sale of our headquarters campus. Other income, net remained relatively constant from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, reflecting primarily an increase in interest income generated from higher average investment portfolio balances earning higher yields in fiscal 2006, offset by the non recurrence of an $8.0 million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables in fiscal 2005. 33 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $84.7 million, $101.8 million and $22.9 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 28%, 50% and 23% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the tax effect attributable to our foreign earnings (net of U.S. tax consequences), changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets, benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and a non recurring adjustment to our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a favorable rate differential on our foreign earnings of $18.3 million. In fiscal 2006, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax expense of approximately $35.5 million related to the repatriation of approximately $708.8 million of qualified earnings under the applicable provisions of the American Jobs creation Act of 2004. In fiscal 2005, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax benefit of $26.7 million recorded as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets. The other significant item impacting our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate was an expense of $11.1 million to adjust our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes, withholding taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be understated after an analysis of all of our income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates, see Note 8 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable security investments, approximately 42% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and was largely generated from our international operations. Our international operations have generated approximately $139.1 million of cumulative earnings that we have determined will be invested indefinitely in our international operations. Were such earnings to be repatriated, we would incur a U.S. Federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements. While our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid, a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year. While typically yielding greater returns, they also reduce reported working capital. We believe that our existing cash and marketable securities investment balances and funds generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. We may elect to use available cash and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source (i.e., cash held in the United States of America versus international locations), the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital. Our cash flows were as follows during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: Years Ended March 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 420.1 $ 420.9 $ 501.9 Net cash used in investing activities (405.9 ) (60.0 ) (234.6 ) Net cash used in financing activities (44.0 ) (278.1 ) (63.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 7.4 3.0 4.2 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (22.4 ) $ 85.8 $ 207.8 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $0.8 million during fiscal 2007 and decreased $81.0 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior years. For fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, the increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, amortization and share based compensation) was mostly offset by the decrease in financed payables. The decrease for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was attributable to increased cash paid for exit costs year over year, plus cash paid for taxes in fiscal 2006 related to our repatriation of foreign earnings slightly offset by settlement of litigation in fiscal 2005. 34 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $345.9 million during fiscal 2007 and decreased $174.6 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. The increase for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable primarily to a $135.8 million increase in cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, resulting from our acquisition of Identify Software in the current period, and $201.8 million period over period increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities. The decrease for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was attributable primarily to a $256.7 million decrease in cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, resulting from our acquisitions of Marimba, Inc. and Calendra, SA in fiscal 2005 and a $33.6 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $115.5 million period over period decrease in proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased $234.1 million during fiscal 2007 and increased $214.4 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. The decrease for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable primarily to the receipt of $291.9 million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our headquarters campus in fiscal 2007 and a $61.6 million period over period increase in proceeds primarily from employee stock option exercises and a $28.6 million increase in excess tax benefit from share based compensation, partially offset by a $144.0 million period over period increase in cash used for treasury stock purchases. The increase for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase of $324.0 million in cash used for treasury stock purchases, partially offset by an increase of $111.6 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Finance Receivables We provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables, enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk. The finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we transferred $174.2 million, $160.9 million and $247.4 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. The high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis. However, to meet the needs of our customers we have been providing more licensing options, and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more customer transactions where cash payments will be received over time. This flexibility may also reduce our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future and may reduce our cash flow from operations in the near term. Treasury Stock Purchased Our Board of Directors has authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program ($500.0 million authorized in April 2000, $500.0 million in July 2002 and $1.0 billion in November 2005). During fiscal 2007, we purchased 20.7 million shares for $555.0 million. From the inception of the repurchase plan through March 31, 2007, we have purchased 85.9 million shares for $1,745.5 million. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The repurchase program will continue to be funded primarily with cash generated from operations. As of March 31, 2007, there was $254.5 million remaining in the stock repurchase program. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2007: Payments due by Period Less Than After 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Capital lease obligations $ 6.2 $ 3.4 $ $ $ 9.6 Operating lease obligations 59.2 86.7 54.2 66.2 266.3 Purchase obligations(1) 3.3 1.8 1.0 6.1 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 1.5 2.9 1.3 5.7 Total contractual obligations(2) $ 70.2 $ 94.8 $ 56.5 $ 66.2 $ 287.7 (1) Represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchase goods or services.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2009. We have not determined whether we will elect to measure items subject to SFAS No. 159 at fair value and, as a result, have not assessed the potential impacts of adoption on our current accounting policies and procedures or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, with certain exceptions including SFAS 123(R), among other pronouncements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2009. We have not determined whether the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and provides that the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return not be recognized in the financial statements unless that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of April 1, 2007, and currently do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non U.S. enterprises is the local currency. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 47.9%, or $756.9 million, 47.0%, or $704.0 million, and 48.1%, or $704.0 million, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from customers outside of the United States, substantially all of which was billed from our regional headquarters, which have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, and was collected in foreign currencies. Similarly, substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies. As a result, our U.S. dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk: forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month. Forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts, with terms generally less than one year, are used to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, transactions. Principal currencies hedged are the euro and British pound in Europe, the Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the Asia Pacific region and the Israeli shekel. While we actively manage much of our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2007, we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments, based on a value at risk (VAR) model utilizing Monte Carlo simulation, which would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. Interest Rate Risk Investments We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2007. Marketable securities (including amounts in cash equivalents of $248.9 million) of $872.5 million primarily represented different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, we classify our marketable securities as available for sale under SFAS No. 115, which provides that no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. Based on our consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2007 and our consolidated results of operations and net cash flows for fiscal 2007, we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows. We used a VAR variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
