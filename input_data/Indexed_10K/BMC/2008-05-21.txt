ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MDA) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview During fiscal 2008, we continued to focus on our leadership in Business Service Management (BSM) by responding to IT executive needs, improving IT service quality and supporting business priorities. Our two software business segments, Enterprise Service Management (ESM) and Mainframe Service Management (MSM), provide the focus to align our resources and product development efforts to meet the demands of the dynamic markets we serve. In addition, our third segment is our Professional Services organization. All three segments demonstrated solid revenue growth in fiscal 2008. The positive growth of our BSM solutions contributed to our solid performance in fiscal 2008. BSM is generally considered by industry experts to be the most effective approach to managing IT based on business priorities, both through the creation of best practices and enhancing the impact that IT infrastructure has on the business. Helping customers manage their IT resources to meet the needs of their businesses requires an approach that can be adopted both universally and incrementally. To accomplish this, we remain focused on three solution areas: Service Support, Service Assurance and Service Automation. Our configuration management database (CMDB) also added to the growth of our BSM solutions. During fiscal 2008, we acquired and successfully integrated multiple companies. In June 2007, we acquired ProactiveNet, a provider of an advanced early warning system for the IT market. The combination of our BSM for IT operations and ProactiveNets unique capabilities represents an advanced solution available for customers looking to align IT services to business priorities. In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of RealOps, a leading provider of run book automation software. RealOps enables us to provide a robust platform for IT process design and execution. The October 2007 acquisition of Emprisa, a leading provider of network configuration automation software, expands our ability to include the configuration of network devices in our service automation offering. Most recently in April 2008, we acquired BladeLogic, a leading provider of data center automation software, which expands our offerings for server provisioning, application release management, as well as configuration automation and compliance. Our acquisitions are discussed in greater detail under the Acquisitions section below. As we deliver a comprehensive BSM strategy, we support both mainframe and distributed systems and integrate them in an enterprise wide approach. A substantial portion of the worlds computer data resides on mainframe servers. Our ability to integrate the mainframe into BSM offers financial services, telecommunications, transportation and other industries significant benefits. Mainframes remain important to our larger enterprise customers as they drive down IT costs and align IT with business objectives. During fiscal 2008, we continued to realize the positive benefits of our cost management actions, in terms of operating efficiency and profitability. We believe there will be additional opportunities to realize operating efficiencies in future periods. During fiscal 2008, we continued to experience an increase in the number and magnitude of license transactions that require ratable recognition of license revenue over the term of the agreement, due to an increase in time based license agreements and an increase in customer transactions containing other terms and conditions that preclude upfront license revenue recognition. In addition to executing time based license agreements, the primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include, but are not limited to, customer arrangements that include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, customer arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights, customer arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering and other contractual terms and conditions that require ratable revenue recognition over the term of the arrangements. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. 21 Table of Contents We continued to enhance shareholder value by increasing the cash returned to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 18.2 million shares for a total value of $579.6 million. It is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and that we plan a portion of our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenue. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter and, therefore, we generally do not know whether revenue has met our expectations until after the end of the quarter. If a shortfall in revenue were to occur in any given quarter, there would be an immediate, and possibly significant, impact to our overall earnings and, most likely, our stock price. Because our software solutions are designed for and marketed to companies to manage their IT infrastructure from a business perspective, demand for our products, and therefore our financial results, are dependent upon corporations continuing to value such solutions and invest in such technology. There are a number of trends that have historically influenced demand for systems management software, including, among others, business demands placed on IT, computing capacity within IT departments, complexity of IT systems, and IT operational costs. Our financial results are also influenced by many economic and industry conditions, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions in the United States and other local economies in which we market products, corporate spending generally, IT budgets, the competitiveness of the systems management software industry, the adoption rate for BSM and the stability of the mainframe market. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, share based compensation, acquired technology, in process research and development, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets, and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of maintenance through independent maintenance renewals, which demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand alone basis. 22 Table of Contents We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in arrangements that include software products for which maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value can be established, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term in the arrangement. In our time based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license fees in time based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years. Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and training services associated with our products, is derived under both time and material and fixed fee arrangements and in most instances is recognized on a proportional performance basis. If no discernable customer deliverable exists until the completion of the professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not involve significant production, modification, or customization of our software products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method. We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators (collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our products and services. In license arrangements with channel partners, title and risk of loss pass to the channel partners upon execution of our arrangements with them and the delivery of our products to the channel partner. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency. In our consolidated statements of operations, revenue is categorized as license, maintenance, and professional services revenue. We allocate fees from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these categories based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in the arrangements and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon managements best estimate of fair value for these elements and finally, apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Managements best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria. 23 Table of Contents Capitalized Software Development Costs Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until the products general availability to customers in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86). Capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the products estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. We evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value, as defined by SFAS No. 86, requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenue as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs. Share Based Compensation We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the Black Scholes option pricing model and the fair value of nonvested stock based upon the intrinsic value at the date of grant. The determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk free interest rate and estimated forfeitures. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from market traded options for our stock, as we believe that the combined volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than either historical or implied volatility alone. We estimate the expected term of options granted using the simplified method allowed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, due to changes in vesting terms and contractual lives of our current options compared to our historical grants. We base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from United States Treasury issues with maturities similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense for those awards that are expected to vest. In addition, we estimate expected achievement of performance measures in determining the expected timing of vesting of our performance based nonvested stock awards. We record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards. 24 Table of Contents If we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Acquired Technology, In Process Research and Development, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values are primarily estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach, which requires us to project the related future revenue and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. We generally use third party valuation experts to assist us in estimating fair values. We amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives. All goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value. When conducting impairment assessments, we are required to estimate future cash flows. The estimates used in valuing all intangible assets, including in process research and development, are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives. Incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in future impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Valuation of Investments Our investments consist of debt and equity securities. We account for our investments in debt securities and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We account for our investments in equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value under the cost method of accounting. We regularly analyze our portfolio of investments for other than temporary declines in fair value. This analysis requires significant judgment as well as the use of estimates and assumptions. The primary factors considered when determining if a charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary include whether: (i) the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis; (ii) the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated; (iii) if a debt security, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security; (iv) the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time; (v) if a debt security, such security has been downgraded by a rating agency; and (vi) we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities. However, from time to time, issuer specific and market specific events could warrant a write down for an other than temporary decline in fair value. As the vast majority of our investments are investment grade securities, we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Investments in debt and equity securities with a fair value below our cost as of March 31, 2008 are discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current years results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities and the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment. We are subject to corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) on April 1, 2007. 25 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no United States taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide United States federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Acquisitions We have consummated multiple acquisitions of businesses in recent years. Each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the purchase accounting method. Accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. Recently Completed Acquisition In April 2008, we acquired BladeLogic, a leading provider of data center automation software, through the successful completion of a tender offer for approximately $830 million in cash, excluding acquisition costs. The BladeLogic acquisition expands our offerings for server provisioning, application release management, as well as configuration automation and compliance. Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions In June 2007, we acquired ProactiveNet, a provider of an advanced early warning system for the IT market, for approximately $41 million in cash. This acquisition advances the solutions available for our customers looking to align IT services to business priorities. In July 2007, we acquired RealOps, a leading provider of run book automation software, for approximately $54 million in cash. This acquisition enables us to provide a robust platform for IT process design and execution. In October 2007, we acquired Emprisa, a leading provider of network configuration automation software, for approximately $22 million in cash. This acquisition expands our ability to include the configuration of network devices in our service automation offering. Fiscal 2007 Acquisition In May 2006, we acquired Identify Software for approximately $151 million in cash. This acquisition provides solutions that optimize application development organizations through the automation of testing, support and maintenance processes and enable dramatic increases in development outputs. Historical Information Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating results, see the Risk Factors section above. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, the percentages that selected items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations bear to total revenue.

Software License Revenue Total software license revenue was $647.6 million, $569.8 million and $527.0 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in total software license revenue of 13.7%, or $77.8 million, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to license revenue increases in both the MSM and ESM segments as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $53.5 million for fiscal 2008, as compared to the prior year period. Of the license revenue transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront decreased from 51% during fiscal 2007 to 50% in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008 we closed 94 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $278.1 million, compared with 89 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $243.1 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in total software license revenue of 8.1%, or $42.8 million, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was attributable to license revenue increases in the ESM segment, partially offset by a slight decline in license revenue in the MSM segment, as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $38.5 million for fiscal 2007, as compared to the prior year period. Of the license transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront decreased from 59% during fiscal 2006 to 51% during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we closed 89 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $243.1 million, compared with 66 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $165.3 million, in fiscal 2006. ESM license revenue represented 54.1%, or $350.5 million, 57.9%, or $330.1 million, and 54.0%, or $284.6 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. ESM license revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 6.2%, or $20.4 million, from fiscal 2007, and for fiscal 2007 increased 16.0%, or $45.5 million, from fiscal 2006. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to increases in demand for our BSM solutions, including incremental license revenue resulting from our fiscal 2008 and 2007 acquisitions, as well as an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year, partially offset by an increase in the level of new license transactions with revenue being deferred into future periods. MSM license revenue represented 45.9%, or $297.1 million, 42.1%, or $239.7 million and 46.0%, or $242.4 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 23.9%, or $57.4 million, from fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year and an increase in the volume of license transactions executed, combined with a decline in the level of new license transactions whose revenues are being deferred into future periods. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2007 remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2006, decreasing 1.1%, or $2.7 million. This fiscal 2007 decrease was attributable primarily to an increase in the level of new license transactions whose revenues are being deferred into future periods, partially offset by a higher volume of license transactions executed and an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year. 28 Table of Contents For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our recognized license revenue was impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Deferrals of license revenue $ (347.2 ) $ (314.8 ) $ (229.3 ) Recognition from deferred license revenue 296.2 242.7 204.2 Net impact on recognized license revenue $ (51.0 ) $ (72.1 ) $ (25.1 ) Deferred license revenue balance at end of year $ 555.4 $ 504.4 $ 432.3 The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include, but are not limited to, customer transactions that include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices, certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights, time based licenses that are recognized over the term of the arrangement, customer transactions that include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the maintenance and or professional services. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. As of March 31, 2008, the deferred license revenue balance was $555.4 million and had an estimated remaining life of approximately three years. As additional license revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred license revenue we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2008 follows (in millions): Fiscal 2009 $ 264.2 Fiscal 2010 $ 159.1 Fiscal 2011 and thereafter $ 132.1 Software Maintenance Revenue Total software maintenance revenue was $967.7 million, $918.8 million and $878.8 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total software maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 5.3%, or $48.9 million, from fiscal 2007. Total software maintenance revenue for fiscal 2007 increased 4.6%, or $40.0 million, from fiscal 2006. These increases were attributable to increases in both ESM and MSM maintenance revenue as discussed below. ESM maintenance revenue represented 53.5%, or $517.4 million, 52.0%, or $478.1 million, and 51.2%, or $449.9 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. ESM maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 8.2%, or $39.3 million, as compared to fiscal 2007, and for fiscal 2007 increased 6.3%, or $28.2 million, as compared to fiscal 2006. These increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed ESM customer license base, including that related to our fiscal 2008 and 2007 acquisitions. MSM maintenance revenue represented 46.5%, or $450.3 million, 48.0%, or $440.7 million, and 48.8% or $428.9 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. MSM maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 2.2%, or $9.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2007 and for fiscal 2007 increased 2.8%, or $11.8 million, as compared to fiscal 2006. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed MSM customer license base and increasing capacities of the current installed base. 29 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2008, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,201.6 million. As new customers are added and or current contracts are renewed and additional maintenance revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred maintenance revenue we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2008 follows (in millions): Fiscal 2009 $ 640.7 Fiscal 2010 $ 325.9 Fiscal 2011 thereafter $ 235.0 Domestic vs. International Revenue Percentage Change 2008 2007 Year Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions) License: Domestic $ 306.2 $ 279.5 $ 263.2 9.6 % 6.2 % International 341.4 290.3 263.8 17.6 % 10.0 % Total license revenue 647.6 569.8 527.0 13.7 % 8.1 % Maintenance: Domestic 525.5 507.4 490.0 3.6 % 3.6 % International 442.2 411.4 388.8 7.5 % 5.8 % Total maintenance revenue 967.7 918.8 878.8 5.3 % 4.6 % Professional services: Domestic 47.1 36.6 41.2 28.7 % (11.2 )% International 69.2 55.2 51.4 25.4 % 7.4 % Total professional services revenue 116.3 91.8 92.6 26.7 % (0.9 )% Total revenue $ 1,731.6 $ 1,580.4 $ 1,498.4 9.6 % 5.5 % License Revenue Our domestic license revenue represented 47.3%, or $306.2 million, 49.1%, or $279.5 million, and 49.9%, or $263.2 million, of license revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Domestic license revenue increased 9.6%, or $26.7 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due to an increase in both MSM and ESM license revenues. Domestic license revenue increased 6.2%, or $16.3 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in ESM license revenue. Our international license revenue represented 52.7%, or $341.4 million, 50.9%, or $290.3 million, and 50.1%, or $263.8 million, of license revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. International license revenue increased 17.6%, or $51.1 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increases in MSM and ESM license revenue in both our European and Latin America markets. International license revenue increased 10.0%, or $26.5 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in ESM license revenue in our European and Asia Pacific markets. These year over year increases were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Maintenance Revenue Our domestic maintenance revenue represented 54.3%, or $525.5 million, 55.2%, or $507.4 million, and 55.8%, or $490.0 million, of maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 3.6%, or $18.1 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in ESM maintenance revenue. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 3.6%, or $17.4 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in ESM maintenance revenue. Our international maintenance revenue represented 45.7%, or $442.2 million, 44.8%, or $411.4 million, and 44.2%, or $388.8 million, of maintenance revenue for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. International maintenance revenue increased 7.5%, or $30.8 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in ESM maintenance revenue in our European and Canadian markets and MSM maintenance revenue in our Latin American market. International maintenance revenue increased 5.8%, or $22.6 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, due to increases in both MSM and ESM maintenance revenue principally in our European market. These year over year increases were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. 30 Table of Contents Professional Services Revenue Professional services revenue increased 26.7%, or $24.5 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, and remained relatively flat from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, decreasing by 0.9%, or $0.8 million. The increase in fiscal 2008 professional services revenue was attributable primarily to increases in domestic and international implementation and consulting services, primarily related to growth in BSM solution sales. Operating Expenses Percentage Change 2008 2007 Year Ended March 31, Compared to Compared to 2008 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions) Cost of license revenue $ 100.4 $ 99.4 $ 123.3 1.0 % (19.4 )% Cost of maintenance revenue 168.9 175.1 175.0 (3.5 )% 0.1 % Cost of professional services revenue 125.1 95.8 83.5 30.6 % 14.7 % Selling and marketing expenses 527.4 518.1 501.6 1.8 % 3.3 % Research and development expenses 209.4 210.7 209.1 (0.6 )% 0.8 % General and administrative expenses 209.4 202.8 203.6 3.3 % (0.4 )% Amortization of intangible assets 14.8 26.6 32.8 (44.4 )% (18.9 )% Severance, exit costs and related charges 14.7 44.6 41.0 (67.0 )% 8.8 % In process research and development 4.0 * * Total operating expenses $ 1,374.1 $ 1,373.1 $ 1,369.9 0.1 % 0.2 % * not meaningful Cost of License Revenue Cost of license revenue consists primarily of (i) amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed products, (ii) amortization of acquired technology for products acquired through business combinations, (iii) license based royalties to third parties and (iv) production and distribution costs for initial product licenses. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, cost of license revenue represented 5.8%, or $100.4 million, 6.3%, or $99.4 million, and 8.2%, or $123.3 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 15.5%, 17.4% and 23.4% of license revenue, respectively. Cost of license revenue increased 1.0%, or $1.0 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increases attributable to the amortization of acquired technology related to recent acquisitions partially offset by reduced license based royalties and the conclusion of the amortization of certain acquired technology. Cost of license revenue decreased 19.4%, or $23.9 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the conclusion of the amortization of certain acquired technologies and a reduction in the amortization of capitalized software development costs, partially offset by the amortization of acquired technology related to Identify Software. Cost of Maintenance Revenue Cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance, enhancement and support services to our customers. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, cost of maintenance revenue represented 9.8%, or $168.9 million, 11.1%, or $175.1 million, and 11.7%, or $175.0 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 17.5%, 19.1% and 19.9% of maintenance revenue, respectively. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased 3.5%, or $6.2 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a reduction in personnel and third party outsourcing costs in connection with ongoing efficiency initiatives, partially offset by the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates associated with international expenses. Cost of maintenance revenue remained flat from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. 31 Table of Contents Cost of Professional Services Revenue Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of salaries, related personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, cost of professional services revenue represented 7.2%, or $125.1 million, 6.1%, or $95.8 million, and 5.6%, or $83.5 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 107.6%, 104.4% and 90.2% of professional services revenue, respectively. Cost of professional services revenue increased 30.6%, or $29.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and 14.7%, or $12.3 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in professional service enablement personnel and an increase in third party consulting fees associated with a larger volume of BSM implementations, as well as the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates associated with international expenses in fiscal 2008. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consists primarily of salaries, related personnel costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, marketing, industry trade shows and sales seminars. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, selling and marketing expenses represented 30.5%, or $527.4 million, 32.8%, or $518.1 million, and 33.5%, or $501.6 million, of total revenue, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased 1.8%, or $9.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increases in sales commissions and related variable compensation expenses, principally due to increased revenue, increases in share based compensation expense and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates associated with international expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased 3.3%, or $16.5 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the addition of share based compensation and an increase in travel and marketing campaign expenditures. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consists primarily of salaries and personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation, such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include computer hardware and software costs, telecommunications costs and personnel costs associated with our development and production labs. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, research and development expenses represented 12.1%, or $209.4 million, 13.3%, or $210.7 million and 14.0%, or $209.1 million, of total revenue, respectively. Research and development expenses decreased 0.6%, or $1.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in research and development personnel and related costs allocated to software development projects that were capitalized, partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates associated with international expenses. Research and development expenses increased 0.8%, or $1.6 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the addition of share based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in personnel and related costs associated with a reduction in research and development personnel. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs of executive management, finance and accounting, facilities management, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses include fees paid for outside accounting and legal services, consulting projects and insurance. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, general and administrative expenses represented 12.1%, or $209.4 million, 12.8%, or $202.8 million and 13.6%, or $203.6 million, of total revenue, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased 3.3%, or $6.6 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in share based compensation expense, partially offset by reductions in professional service and consulting fees. General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4%, or $0.8 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to lower professional service and consulting fees and a decrease in employee separation charges and other personnel related cost including travel and recruitment, partially offset by the addition of share based compensation. 32 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of finite lived customer relationships and tradenames recorded in connection with acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 44.4%, or $11.8 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the conclusion of the amortization of certain intangibles, partially offset by additional amortization associated with intangibles acquired in connection with fiscal 2008 acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 18.9%, or $6.2 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the conclusion of amortization of certain intangibles at the end of fiscal 2006, partially offset by incremental amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Identify Software in fiscal 2007. Severance, Exit Costs and Related Charges We have undertaken various restructuring and process improvement initiatives in recent years to reduce costs through the realignment of resources to focus on growth areas and simplification, standardization and automation of key business processes. As a result of these initiatives, we identified for termination approximately 250, 700 and 700 employees during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These workforce reductions were across all functions and geographies and affected employees were, or will be, provided cash separation packages. The workforce reductions have primarily reduced selling and marketing and research and development headcount in product areas that were not realizing our profitability and growth goals, as well as general and administrative headcount. Additionally, during these same periods we exited leases in certain locations, reduced the square footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities. We estimate that the initiatives that have been undertaken through fiscal 2008 will result in fiscal 2009 savings in the range of approximately $55 to $65 million as compared to fiscal 2008 expense levels. We will continue to evaluate additional actions that may be necessary in the future to achieve the aforementioned business goals. In Process Research and Development During fiscal 2008, we wrote off acquired in process research and development (IPRD) totaling $4.0 million in connection with our fiscal 2008 business acquisitions. The amounts allocated to IPRD represent the estimated fair values, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to core research and development projects that were incomplete and had neither reached technological feasibility nor been determined to have an alternative future use pending achievement of technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. There were no acquired IPRD write offs during fiscal 2007 and 2006. Other Income, net Other income, net, consists primarily of interest earned, realized gains and losses on investments, rental income on previously owned facilities and interest expense on capital leases. Other income, net was $76.9 million, $93.3 million and $75.3 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other income, net, decreased 17.6%, or $16.4 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower average yields, lower finance receivable balances and lower realized gains on investments. Other income, net, increased 23.9%, or $18.0 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to realized gains on investments, higher interest income generated from higher average investment portfolio balances earning higher yields and the impact of certain derivative instruments not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. This was partially offset by a reduction in rental income resulting from the sale of our headquarters campus. 33 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $120.8 million, $84.7 million and $101.8 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 27.8%, 28.2% and 50.0% for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the worldwide mix of consolidated earnings before taxes and the Companys policy of indefinitely re investing earnings in certain low tax jurisdictions, changes in the Companys uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets, benefits associated with income attributable to both domestic production activities and the extraterritorial income exclusion and the writeoff of in process research and development costs associated with certain acquisitions. In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a favorable rate differential on our foreign earnings of $27.6 million and $18.3 million, respectively. In fiscal 2006, the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax expense of approximately $35.5 million related to the repatriation of approximately $708.8 million of qualified earnings under the applicable provisions of the American Jobs creation Act of 2004. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates, see Note 8 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, approximately 42% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and was largely generated from our international operations. Our international operations have generated approximately $121.6 million of cumulative earnings that we have determined will be invested indefinitely in our international operations. Were such earnings to be repatriated, we would incur a United States Federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements. While our investments are primarily investment grade and highly liquid, a significant portion of our portfolio is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year. While typically yielding greater returns, they also reduce reported working capital. As of March 31, 2008, the Company held auction rate securities with a par value of $72.2 million and an estimated fair value of $68.9 million. Auction rate securities are long term debt instruments with interest rates that reset through periodic short term auctions. If there are insufficient buyers, then the auction fails and holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction. A failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument, but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the original terms of the debt instrument. A failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction, until such time as another market for auction rate securities develops, until the debt instrument is redeemed and refinanced by the issuer or until the final stated maturity of the issue, which is typically 30 to 40 years after initial issuance. Auction rate securities are generally callable at any time by the issuer. Scheduled auctions continue to be held until the auction rate security matures or until it is called. During the timeframe beginning in February 2008 through March 31, 2008, and through May 20, 2008, the majority of auction rate securities in the marketplace, including auction rate securities that we held in our portfolio, failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. Our auction rate securities consist entirely of bonds issued by public agencies that are backed by student loans with at least a 97% guarantee by the federal government under the United States Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. These bonds are currently rated AAA by Moodys and Standard and Poors. We do not have reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our auction rate securities are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our auction rate security investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on our ability to access cash and other short term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and other sources of cash that we expect to be available, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity of these investments to have a material impact on our business strategy, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As previously discussed, subsequent to March 31, 2008, we acquired BladeLogic in April 2008, through the successful completion of a tender offer for approximately $830 million in cash, excluding acquisition costs. We have paid for this acquisition with cash we had on hand at the date of acquisition. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances and funds generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. We may elect to use available cash and investments to fund such activities in the future. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source (i.e., cash held in the United States versus international locations), the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital. 34 Table of Contents Our cash flows were as follows during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended March 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 593.7 $ 420.1 $ 420.9 Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities 221.4 (405.9 ) (60.0 ) Net cash used in financing activities (438.2 ) (44.0 ) (278.1 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 27.9 7.4 3.0 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 404.8 $ (22.4 ) $ 85.8 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $173.6 million, from $420.1 million in fiscal 2007 to $593.7 million in fiscal 2008, due primarily to higher cash receipts on finance receivables and an increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, amortization and share based compensation). Net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $221.4 million during fiscal 2008 and net cash used in investing activities was $405.9 million during fiscal 2007. This difference was attributable primarily to lower purchases of investments and a reduction in the amount of cash expended for acquisitions year over year, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 increased by $345.9 million as compared to net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2006, due primarily to higher purchases of investments and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased $394.2 million during fiscal 2008 and decreased $234.1 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior years. The fiscal 2008 increase was attributable primarily to the receipt of $291.9 million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our headquarters campus in fiscal 2007, an increase in treasury stock purchases and a decrease in cash received from stock option exercises. The fiscal 2007 decrease was attributable primarily to the receipt of $291.9 million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our headquarters campus in fiscal 2007 and a $61.6 million year over year increase in proceeds primarily from employee stock option exercises and a $28.6 million increase in excess tax benefit from share based compensation, partially offset by a $144.0 million year over year increase in cash used for treasury stock purchases. Finance Receivables We provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables, enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk. The finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we transferred $267.5 million, $174.2 million and $160.9 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. The high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis. 35 Table of Contents Treasury Stock Purchased Our Board of Directors had previously authorized a total of $2.0 billion to repurchase stock. In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase stock. During fiscal 2008, we purchased 18.2 million shares for $579.6 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase authorization through March 31, 2008, we have purchased 104.0 million shares for $2.3 billion. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The repurchase of stock will continue to be funded primarily with cash generated from domestic operations and, therefore, affects our overall domestic versus international liquidity balances. As of March 31, 2008, there was $674.9 million remaining in the stock repurchase program, which does not have an expiration date. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2008: Payments due by Period Less Than After 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Capital lease obligations $ 6.3 $ 5.4 $ 1.4 $ $ 13.1 Operating lease obligations 56.1 68.3 37.9 29.7 192.0 Purchase obligations(1) 3.8 1.9 0.5 6.2 Acquisition of BladeLogic(2) 830.0 830.0 Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 11.4 2.8 14.2 Total contractual obligations(3)(4) $ 907.6 $ 78.4 $ 39.8 $ 29.7 $ 1.055.5 (1) Represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchase goods or services. The agreements are enforceable and legally binding, and contain specific terms, including quantities to be purchased and the timing of the purchase. (2) Represents the estimated payment obligation to purchase BladeLogic as of March 31, 2008, excluding acquisition costs. This acquisition was consummated on April 18, 2008. (3) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, other than capital lease obligations and other liabilities above. (4) We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $138.6 million, including interest and penalties, is not included in the table above. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We have not yet determined whether the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), which changes the accounting for business combinations including: (i) the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, (ii) the recognition of contingent consideration, (iii) the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, (iv) the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, (v) the accounting for acquisition related restructuring costs, (vi) the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, and (vii) the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our financial position or results of operations is dependent upon the nature and terms of business combinations, if any, that we may consummate in fiscal 2010 and thereafter. 36 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses be reported in earnings for items measured using the fair value option. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2009. We do not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, with certain exceptions. In February 2008, the FASB issued two FASB staff positions that remove leasing from the scope of SFAS No. 157 and delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for us to April 1, 2009 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). The required provisions of SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively beginning April 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non United States enterprises is the local currency. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 49.2%, or $852.8 million, 47.9%, or $756.9 million and 47.0%, or $704.0 million, of our total revenue was derived from customers outside of the United States, substantially all of which was billed from our regional headquarters, which have the United States dollar as the functional currency, and was collected in foreign currencies. Similarly, substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries were incurred in foreign currencies. As a result, our United States dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize certain derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts in managing our foreign currency exchange risk. Forward exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month. Principal currencies hedged are the euro and British pound in Europe, the Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the Asia Pacific region and the Israeli shekel. While we actively manage much of our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at March 31, 2008, we estimate that a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments, based on a value at risk (VAR) model utilizing Monte Carlo simulation, would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. Interest Rate Risk We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2008. Investments (including amounts in cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion) of $1.5 billion primarily represented different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, we classify our investments as available for sale under SFAS No. 115, which provides that no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. 37 Table of Contents Based on our consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2008 and our consolidated results of operations and net cash flows for fiscal 2008, we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows. We used a VAR variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our investments due to interest rate fluctuations. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool, and as such, is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred.
