ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview During fiscal 2009, the United States and global economies entered into recession. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment that developed during the fiscal year, we continued to focus on our leadership in BSM by responding to IT executive needs to reduce cost, increase business impact, improve service quality, manage risk and provide greater transparency. Our two business segments, ESM and MSM, continue to provide the focus necessary to align our resources and product development efforts to meet the demands of the dynamic markets we serve. Our fiscal 2009 financial performance in terms of revenue, expense management, operating income and earnings per share was strong, despite the continuing uncertainty in the global markets. While our operating cash flows for the fiscal year fell short of our expectations, due primarily to elongated contract approval cycles that we started to see in our fourth quarter that caused a higher percentage of our invoicing activity to occur in the latter part of the quarter, we nevertheless recorded strong transactional bookings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we closed an increased number of large transactions with more complex terms and conditions that resulted in a higher percentage of license transaction bookings being deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the underlying contractual maintenance terms rather than recorded entirely upfront at the time of the transactions. The primary reasons for license revenue deferral are discussed further under Results of Operations Software License Revenue, and Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition, in MD&A herein. Overall, we believe that our strong fiscal 2009 performance reflects the tangible value that our solutions offer customers in both good and difficult economic environments, along with our ability to control and manage our expenses. In April 2008, we acquired BladeLogic, a leading provider of data center automation software, for total purchase consideration of $854.0 million. This was a significant acquisition for us as it has expanded our service automation offerings for server provisioning, application release management, and configuration automation and compliance. During the fiscal year, BladeLogic was successfully integrated into our operations. In June 2008, we completed the issuance of $300.0 million in senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the Notes). Net proceeds from this offering amounted to $295.6 million, which were used for general corporate purposes. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We continue to enhance shareholder value by returning cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 10.7 million shares for a total value of $330.0 million. Going into fiscal 2010, we expect that we will continue to see elongated customer contract approval cycles, similar to the fourth quarter, which may have the impact of delaying operating cash flows from quarter to quarter, and that our license revenue recognition ratable rates will be higher due to more complex customer contract terms and conditions and other factors that preclude upfront license revenue recognition. It is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan a portion of our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenue. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter and, therefore, we generally do not know whether revenue has met our expectations until after the end of the quarter. If a shortfall in revenue were to occur in any given quarter, there would be an immediate, and possibly significant, impact to our overall earnings and, most likely, our stock price. Because our software solutions are designed for and marketed to companies looking to improve the management of their IT infrastructure and processes, demand for our products, and therefore our financial results, are dependent upon corporations continuing to value such solutions and invest in such technology. There are a number of trends that have historically influenced demand for IT management software, including, among others, business demands placed on IT, computing capacity within IT departments, complexity of IT systems and IT operational costs. Our financial results are also influenced by many economic and industry conditions, including, but not limited to, general economic and market conditions in the United States and other economies in which we market products, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, corporate spending generally, IT budgets, the competitiveness of the IT management software industry, the adoption rate for BSM and the stability of the mainframe market. The current highly volatile and uncertain economic conditions globally, forecasts of contracting IT spending and the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph may adversely impact our future revenue, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. While our operating plans include continued discipline in controlling expenses and ongoing efforts to simplify processes and increase efficiencies, there can be no assurance that expense control efforts would offset such adverse conditions. Acquisitions We have consummated multiple acquisitions of businesses in recent years. Each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the purchase accounting method. Accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. Fiscal 2009 Acquisition In April 2008, we acquired BladeLogic, a leading provider of data center automation software, through the successful completion of a tender offer for approximately $830 million in cash, excluding acquisition costs. The BladeLogic acquisition expands our offerings for server provisioning, application release management, as well as configuration automation and compliance. Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions In June 2007, we acquired ProactiveNet, a provider of an advanced early warning system for the IT market, for approximately $41 million in cash. This acquisition advances the solutions available for our customers looking to align IT services to business priorities. In July 2007, we acquired RealOps, a leading provider of run book automation software, for approximately $54 million in cash. This acquisition enables us to provide a robust 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements platform for IT process design and execution. In October 2007, we acquired Emprisa, a leading provider of network configuration automation software, for approximately $22 million in cash. This acquisition expands our ability to include the configuration of network devices in our service automation offering. Fiscal 2007 Acquisition In May 2006, we acquired Identify Software for approximately $151 million in cash. This acquisition provides solutions that optimize application development organizations through the automation of testing, support and maintenance processes and enables dramatic increases in development outputs. Historical Information Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings will be sustained at these levels.

License revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 9.6%, or $62.1 million, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to license revenue increases in the ESM segment, partially offset by a license revenue decrease in the MSM segment, as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $25.7 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Of the license revenue transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront remained constant at 50% during fiscal 2009 and 2008. During fiscal 2009, we closed 135 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $364.3 million, compared with 94 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $278.1 million, in fiscal 2008. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements License revenue in fiscal 2008 increased by 13.7%, or $77.8 million, over fiscal 2007. This increase was attributable to license revenue increases in both the MSM and ESM segments, as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue that was deferred in prior periods increased $55.7 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Of the license transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront decreased from 51% during fiscal 2007 to 50% during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we closed 94 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $278.1 million, compared with 89 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $243.1 million, in fiscal 2007. ESM license revenue represented 61.4%, or $436.1 million, 54.1%, or $350.5 million, and 57.9%, or $330.1 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. ESM license revenue for fiscal 2009 increased 24.4%, or $85.6 million, from fiscal 2008, and for fiscal 2008 increased 6.2%, or $20.4 million, from fiscal 2007. These increases were attributable primarily to increased demand for our BSM solutions, inclusive of incremental revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic in April 2008 and our fiscal 2008 acquisitions, as well as an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year, partially offset by an increase in the level of new license transactions with revenue being deferred into future periods. ESM license revenue contributed by BladeLogic products amounted to $57.5 million in fiscal 2009. MSM license revenue represented 38.6%, or $273.6 million, 45.9%, or $297.1 million, and 42.1%, or $239.7 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased 7.9%, or $23.5 million, from fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of new license transactions executed, partially offset by an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year. MSM license revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 23.9%, or $57.4 million, from fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year and an increase in the volume of new license transactions executed, combined with a decline in the level of new transactions whose revenue was deferred into future periods. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, our recognized license revenue was impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Deferrals of license revenue $ (383.2 ) $ (347.2 ) $ (314.8 ) Recognition from deferred license revenue 324.2 298.5 $ 242.8 Impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 3.5 (2.3 ) (0.1 ) Net impact to deferred license revenue $ (55.5 ) $ (51.0 ) $ (72.1 ) Deferred license revenue balance at end of year $ 610.9 $ 555.4 $ 504.4 The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include, but are not limited to, customer transactions that include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices, certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights, time based licenses that are recognized over the term of the arrangement, customer transactions that include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and or professional services. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. As of March 31, 2009, the deferred license revenue balance was $610.9 million. As additional license revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. Estimated deferred license revenue that we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2009 is (in millions): Fiscal 2010 $ 322.2 Fiscal 2011 165.1 Fiscal 2012 and thereafter 123.6 $ 610.9 Software Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue was $1,017.8 million, $967.7 million and $918.8 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 5.2%, or $50.1 million, over fiscal 2008. Maintenance revenue in fiscal 2008 increased by 5.3%, or $48.9 million, over fiscal 2007. These increases were attributable to increases in both ESM and MSM maintenance revenue, as discussed below. ESM maintenance revenue represented 54.0%, or $550.1 million, 53.5%, or $517.4 million, and 52.0%, or $478.1 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. ESM maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 6.3%, or $32.7 million, over fiscal 2008, and in fiscal 2008 increased by 8.2%, or $39.3 million, over fiscal 2007. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed ESM customer license base, including incremental maintenance revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic in April 2008 and our fiscal 2008 and 2007 acquisitions. Maintenance revenue contributed by BladeLogic products was $17.3 million in fiscal 2009. MSM maintenance revenue represented 46.0%, or $467.7 million, 46.5%, or $450.3 million, and 48.0% or $440.7 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. MSM maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 3.9%, or $17.4 million, over fiscal 2008, and in fiscal 2008 increased by 2.2%, or $9.6 million, over fiscal 2007. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed MSM customer license base and increasing capacities of the current installed base. As of March 31, 2009, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,159.1 million. As new customers are added and or current contracts are renewed and additional maintenance revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. Estimated deferred maintenance revenue that we expect to recognize in future periods as of March 31, 2009 is (in millions): Fiscal 2010 $ 637.6 Fiscal 2011 301.1 Fiscal 2012 and thereafter 220.4 $ 1,159.1 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Domestic vs. International Revenue Percentage Change Year Ended March 31, 2009Compared to2008 2008Compared to2007 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) License: Domestic $ 361.7 $ 306.2 $ 279.5 18.1 % 9.6 % International 348.0 341.4 290.3 1.9 % 17.6 % Total license revenue 709.7 647.6 569.8 9.6 % 13.7 % Maintenance: Domestic 555.5 525.5 507.4 5.7 % 3.6 % International 462.3 442.2 411.4 4.5 % 7.5 % Total maintenance revenue 1,017.8 967.7 918.8 5.2 % 5.3 % Professional services: Domestic 62.8 47.1 36.6 33.3 % 28.7 % International 81.6 69.2 55.2 17.9 % 25.4 % Total professional services revenue 144.4 116.3 91.8 24.2 % 26.7 % Total revenue $ 1,871.9 $ 1,731.6 $ 1,580.4 8.1 % 9.6 % We estimate that the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international revenue resulted in an approximate $9.0 million reduction in total fiscal 2009 revenue as compared to fiscal 2008 and an approximate $47.0 million increase in total fiscal 2008 revenue as compared to fiscal 2007, on a constant currency basis. Domestic License Revenue Domestic license revenue represented 51.0%, or $361.7 million, 47.3%, or $306.2 million, and 49.1%, or $279.5 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Domestic license revenue increased 18.1%, or $55.5 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, due to a $66.2 million increase in ESM license revenue, including incremental license revenue of $40.5 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, offset by a $10.7 million decrease in MSM license revenue. Domestic license revenue increased 9.6%, or $26.7 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due to increases of $23.6 million and $3.1 million in MSM and ESM license revenues, respectively. International License Revenue International license revenue represented 49.0%, or $348.0 million, 52.7%, or $341.4 million, and 50.9%, or $290.3 million, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. International license revenue increased 1.9%, or $6.6 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, due to a $19.4 million increase in ESM license revenue, including incremental license revenue of $17.0 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, offset by a $12.8 million decrease in MSM license revenue. The ESM license revenue increase was attributable to a $15.5 million increase in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) markets, principally due to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $6.0 million increase in our Asia Pacific market, partially offset by a $2.1 million net decrease in our other international markets. The MSM license revenue decrease was attributable primarily to decreases of $7.2 million and $5.7 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International license revenue increased 17.6%, or $51.1 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due to a $33.7 million increase in MSM license revenue and a $17.4 million increase in ESM license revenue. The MSM license revenue increase was attributable primarily to increases of $19.4 million and $13.9 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively. The ESM license revenue increase was attributable to increases of $13.3 million and $7.1 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively, partially offset by a $3.0 million net decrease in other international markets. Domestic Maintenance Revenue Domestic maintenance revenue represented 54.6%, or $555.5 million, 54.3%, or $525.5 million, and 55.2%, or $507.4 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 5.7%, or $30.0 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, due to a $22.7 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue, including incremental maintenance revenue of $14.1 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $7.3 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue. Domestic maintenance revenue increased 3.6%, or $18.1 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due primarily to an $18.9 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue. International Maintenance Revenue International maintenance revenue represented 45.4%, or $462.3 million, 45.7%, or $442.2 million, and 44.8%, or $411.4 million, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. International maintenance revenue increased 4.5%, or $20.1 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, due to a $10.1 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue and a $10.0 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue, including incremental ESM maintenance revenue of $3.2 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic. The MSM maintenance revenue increase was attributable to increases of $7.3 million and $4.5 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively, partially offset by a $1.7 million net decrease in our other international markets. The ESM maintenance revenue increase was attributable primarily to increases of $9.0 million and $1.1 million in our EMEA and Asia Pacific markets, respectively. International maintenance revenue increased 7.5%, or $30.8 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due to a $20.4 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue and a $10.4 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue. The ESM maintenance revenue increase was attributable to increases of $10.0 million, $4.6 million, $3.3 million and $2.5 million in our EMEA, Canadian, Asia Pacific and Latin American markets, respectively. The MSM maintenance revenue increase was attributable primarily to increases of $4.3 million, $2.8 million and $2.7 million in our Latin American, EMEA and Asia Pacific markets, respectively. Professional Services Revenue Professional services revenue increased 24.2%, or $28.1 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, and increased 26.7%, or $24.5 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. Domestic professional services revenue increased 33.3%, or $15.7 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, and increased 28.7%, or $10.5 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. International professional services revenue increased 17.9%, or $12.4 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, and increased 25.4%, or $14.0 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to increases in implementation and consulting services, principally related to growth in BSM solution sales and inclusive of incremental professional services revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic as it relates to the fiscal 2009 increase. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Expenses Percentage Change Year Ended March 31, 2009Compared to2008 2008Compared to2007 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Cost of license revenue $ 117.1 $ 100.4 $ 99.4 16.6 % 1.0 % Cost of maintenance revenue 166.3 168.9 175.1 (1.5 )% (3.5 )% Cost of professional services revenue 141.6 125.1 95.8 13.2 % 30.6 % Selling and marketing expenses 541.5 527.4 518.1 2.7 % 1.8 % Research and development expenses 222.0 209.4 210.7 6.0 % (0.6 )% General and administrative expenses 197.7 209.4 202.8 (5.6 )% 3.3 % In process research and development 50.3 4.0 * * Severance, exit costs and related charges 33.5 14.7 44.6 127.9 % (67.0 )% Amortization of intangible assets 34.1 14.8 26.6 130.4 % (44.4 )% Total operating expenses $ 1,504.1 $ 1,374.1 $ 1,373.1 9.5 % 0.1 % * not meaningful We estimate that the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international expenses resulted in an approximate $28.0 million reduction in fiscal 2009 operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2008 and an approximate $46.0 million increase in fiscal 2008 operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2007, on a constant currency basis. Cost of License Revenue Cost of license revenue consists primarily of the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed products, the amortization of acquired technology for products acquired through business combinations, license based royalties to third parties and production and distribution costs for initial product licenses. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, cost of license revenue represented 6.3%, or $117.1 million, 5.8%, or $100.4 million, and 6.3%, or $99.4 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 16.5%, 15.5% and 17.4% of license revenue, respectively. Cost of license revenue increased 16.6%, or $16.7 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable primarily to a $16.9 million increase in the amortization of acquired technology related to fiscal 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. Cost of license revenue increased 1.0%, or $1.0 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a $13.0 million increase in the amortization of acquired technology related to fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 acquisitions, principally offset by a $10.5 million reduction in amortization associated with technology acquired in connection with earlier acquisitions that became fully amortized and a $1.5 million reduction in license based royalty expense. Cost of Maintenance Revenue Cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance, enhancement and support services to our customers. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, cost of maintenance revenue represented 8.9%, or $166.3 million, 9.8%, or $168.9 million, and 11.1%, or $175.1 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 16.3%, 17.5% and 19.1% of maintenance revenue, respectively. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased 1.5%, or $2.6 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in third party outsourcing costs and a $0.8 million net decrease in other expenses. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cost of maintenance revenue decreased 3.5%, or $6.2 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This decrease was attributable to a $6.0 million reduction in personnel and third party outsourcing costs in connection with ongoing efficiency initiatives and a $3.3 million net decrease in other expenses, partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in share based compensation expense. Cost of Professional Services Revenue Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of salaries, related personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our customers and the related infrastructure to support this business. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, cost of professional services revenue represented 7.6%, or $141.6 million, 7.2%, or $125.1 million, and 6.1%, or $95.8 million, of total revenue, respectively, and 98.1%, 107.6% and 104.4% of professional services revenue, respectively. Cost of professional services revenue increased 13.2%, or $16.5 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable primarily to a $10.1 million increase in professional service enablement personnel costs, a $3.5 million increase in third party consulting fees and a $2.1 million increase in share based compensation expense. The increases in personnel and third party costs were associated primarily with a larger volume of BSM implementations, including incremental costs associated with our acquisition of BladeLogic. Cost of professional services revenue increased 30.6%, or $29.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a $13.6 million increase in professional service enablement personnel costs, a $13.9 million increase in third party consulting fees and a $1.8 million net increase in other costs. The increases in personnel and third party costs were associated primarily with a larger volume of BSM implementations. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, related personnel costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, marketing, industry trade shows and sales seminars. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, selling and marketing expenses represented 28.9%, or $541.5 million, 30.5%, or $527.4 million, and 32.8%, or $518.1 million, of total revenue, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses increased 2.7%, or $14.1 million, from fiscal 2008 to 2009. This increase was attributable to a $13.1 million increase in sales personnel costs and related variable compensation expense, primarily associated with increased revenue and our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $6.9 million increase in share based compensation expense, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in marketing campaign expenditures. Selling and marketing expenses increased 1.8%, or $9.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a $5.5 million increase in sales personnel costs and related variable compensation expense, primarily associated with increased revenue, and a $7.5 million increase in share based compensation expense, partially offset by a $3.7 million net decrease in other expenses. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation, such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include computer hardware and software costs, telecommunications costs and personnel costs associated with our development and production labs. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, research and development expenses represented 11.9%, or $222.0 million, 12.1%, or $209.4 million, and 13.3%, or $210.7 million, of total revenue, respectively. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Research and development expenses increased 6.0%, or $12.6 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable primarily to a $9.6 million increase in research and development personnel and related costs, resulting principally from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $2.5 million increase in share based compensation expense. Research and development expenses decreased 0.6%, or $1.3 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This decrease was attributable to an $18.3 million increase in research and development personnel and related costs, including a $2.8 million increase in share based compensation expense, which was slightly more than offset by the combination of a $16.4 million year over year increase in research and development personnel and related costs allocated to software development projects that were capitalized and a $3.2 million net decrease in other expenses. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs of executive management, finance and accounting, facilities management, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses include fees paid for outside accounting and legal services, consulting projects and insurance. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, general and administrative expenses represented 10.6%, or $197.7 million, 12.1%, or $209.4 million, and 12.8%, or $202.8 million, of total revenue, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased 5.6%, or $11.7 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $10.8 million decrease in personnel and related costs and a $4.9 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in share based compensation expense and a $1.9 million net increase in other expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 3.3%, or $6.6 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a $10.9 million increase in share based compensation expense, a $5.9 million increase in personnel and related costs and a $1.2 million net increase in other expenses, partially offset by an $11.4 million reduction in professional service and consulting fees. In Process Research and Development The amounts allocated to IPR&D represent the estimated fair values, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to core research and development projects that were incomplete and had neither reached technological feasibility nor been determined to have an alternative future use pending achievement of technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2009, we expensed acquired in process research and development (IPR&D) totaling $50.3 million in connection with our first quarter acquisition of BladeLogic. The BladeLogic IPR&D relates primarily to the development of a major new release to an existing core product that we released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The estimated cost of completing this project as of the acquisition date was approximately $7.4 million, which did not materially change upon its release. During fiscal 2008, we expensed IPR&D totaling $4.0 million in connection with our fiscal 2008 business acquisitions. There were no acquired IPR&D charges during fiscal 2007. Severance, Exit Costs and Related Charges We have undertaken various restructuring and process improvement initiatives in recent years through the realignment of resources to focus on growth areas and the simplification, standardization and automation of key business processes. Additionally, as a result of current economic conditions, we undertook general workforce reductions in the latter half of fiscal 2009. Related to these collective actions, we recorded charges of $33.5 million, $14.7 million, and $44.6 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These expenses were attributable primarily to identified workforce reductions and associated cash separation packages paid or accrued by us. While we will reduce future operating expenses as a result of these actions, we anticipate that these 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reductions will be substantially offset by incremental personnel related expenses due to headcount growth in strategic areas. We will continue to evaluate additional actions that may be necessary in the future to achieve our business goals. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization of finite lived customer contracts and relationships and tradenames recorded in connection with acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets increased 130.4%, or $19.3 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, due to $27.7 million in additional amortization associated with intangibles acquired in connection with our fiscal 2009 and 2008 acquisitions, partially offset by an $8.4 million reduction in amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with earlier acquisitions that became fully amortized. Amortization of intangible assets decreased 44.4%, or $11.8 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, due to a $13.3 million reduction in amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with prior acquisitions that became fully amortized, partially offset by $1.5 million in additional amortization associated with intangibles acquired in connection with fiscal 2008 acquisitions. Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net, consists primarily of interest earned, realized gains and losses and impairments on investments and interest expense on our Notes and capital leases. Other income (loss), net, was $(3.9) million, $76.9 million and $93.3 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other income, net, decreased 105.1%, or $80.8 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $42.1 million decrease in interest income, resulting from lower average investment yields on lower average investment balances, a $15.9 million increase in interest expense related to our Notes issued in fiscal 2009, $8.4 million in charges related to the write down of certain non marketable equity investments, a $7.8 million increase in recognized losses related to the investments in our deferred compensation program, $5.3 million in foreign currency exchange impact and a $1.3 million net decrease in other items. Other income, net, decreased 17.6%, or $16.4 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This decrease was attributable primarily to an $8.2 million reduction in realized gains on investments, a $4.6 million decrease in interest income, resulting from lower average investment yields and lower financed receivable balances, and a nonrecurring $2.4 million gain recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the impact of certain derivative instruments not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $125.8 million, $120.8 million and $84.7 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.6%, 27.8% and 28.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the worldwide mix of consolidated earnings before taxes and our policy of indefinitely re investing earnings from certain low tax jurisdictions, additional accruals and changes in estimates related to our uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets, benefits associated with income attributable to both domestic production activities and the extraterritorial income exclusion and the non deductible write off of IPR&D expense associated with certain acquisitions. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 6.6% as a result of our $50.3 million write off of IPR&D expense in connection with the BladeLogic acquisition, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2009, we had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, approximately 37% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and was largely generated from our international operations. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our international operations have generated $194.5 million of earnings that we have determined will be invested indefinitely in our international operations. Were such earnings to be repatriated, we would incur a United States federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements. In June 2008, we issued $300.0 million of Notes. Net proceeds to us after discount and issuance costs amounted to $295.6 million, which were used for general corporate purposes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year payable semi annually in June and December of each year. The Notes are redeemable at our option at any time in whole or, from time to time, in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points, plus, accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are subject to the provisions of an indenture which includes covenants limiting, among other things, the creation of liens securing indebtedness and sale leaseback transactions. As of March 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such debt covenants. As of March 31, 2009, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $72.2 million and an estimated fair value of $60.0 million. Our auction rate securities consist entirely of bonds issued by public agencies that are backed by student loans with at least a 97% guarantee by the federal government under the United States Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. All of these bonds are currently rated investment grade by Moodys and Standard and Poors. Auctions for these securities began failing in early 2008 and have continued to fail through May 2009, resulting in our continuing to hold such securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rates. We do not believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing the auction rate security investments have been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on our current ability to access cash and other short term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and other sources of cash that we expect to be available, we do not anticipate the recent lack of liquidity of these investments to have a material impact on our business strategy, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, in November 2008, we entered into a put agreement with a bank from which we have acquired certain auction rate securities with a par value of $17.7 million and an estimated fair value of $15.7 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to put these auction rate securities at par value to the bank any time during the period beginning June 30, 2010 and ending June 30, 2012. The bank also has the right to repurchase these auction rate securities at par value on or before June 30, 2010. We believe that our existing cash and investment balances and funds generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. We may elect to use available cash and investments to fund such activities in the future. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source (i.e., cash held in the United States versus international locations), the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital. We may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire securities, including outstanding debt and equity securities, in open market repurchases, unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as will comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and contractual restrictions, if applicable. The amount of repurchases may be material and may change from period to period. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our cash flows during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were: Year Ended March 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 579.7 $ 593.7 $ 420.1 Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities (851.9 ) 221.4 (405.9 ) Net cash provided by (used) in financing activities 57.4 (438.2 ) (44.0 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (50.2 ) 27.9 7.4 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (265.0 ) $ 404.8 $ (22.4 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. From fiscal 2008 to 2009, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $14.0 million, from $593.7 million to $579.7 million, due primarily to a net reduction in cash receipts on our receivables, offset by a net increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, amortization and share based compensation) and other working capital changes. From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $173.6 million, due primarily to a net increase in cash receipts on our receivables and an increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, amortization and share based compensation). Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $851.9 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $221.4 million in fiscal 2008. This difference was attributable primarily to cash expended in the current period for our acquisition of BladeLogic and a year over year decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by year over year decreases in investment purchases and purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities was $221.4 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $405.9 million in fiscal 2007. This difference was attributable primarily to lower purchases of investments and a reduction in the amount of cash expended for acquisitions year over year, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $57.4 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $438.2 million in fiscal 2008. This difference was attributable primarily to net proceeds received related to the issuance of our Notes in fiscal 2009 and a year over year decrease in treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises, an increase in stock repurchases to satisfy withholding obligations and an increase in payments under debt and capital lease obligations. From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, net cash used in financing activities increased by $394.2 million, from $44.0 million to $438.2 million, due primarily to the receipt of $291.9 million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our headquarters campus in fiscal 2007, an increase in treasury stock purchases and a decrease in cash received from stock option exercises. Finance Receivables We provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables, enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk. The finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis. We record such transfers of finance receivables 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables, including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors. We have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we transferred $149.7 million, $267.5 million and $174.2 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. Treasury Stock Purchased Our Board of Directors had previously authorized a total of $3.0 billion to repurchase common stock. During fiscal 2009, we purchased 10.7 million shares for $330.0 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase authorization through March 31, 2009, we have purchased 114.7 million shares for $2.7 billion. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. In addition, during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 0.4 million shares for $16.2 million to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon the lapse of restrictions on nonvested stock grants. As of March 31, 2009, there was $344.8 million remaining in the stock repurchase program, which does not have an expiration date. The repurchase of stock will continue to be funded primarily with cash generated from domestic operations and, therefore, affects our overall domestic versus international liquidity balances. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2009: Payments due by Period Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total (In millions) Senior unsecured notes(1) $ 21.8 $ 43.5 $ 43.5 $ 390.6 $ 499.4 Capital lease obligations(1) 7.8 11.7 3.2 22.7 Operating lease obligations 41.1 60.0 37.1 26.9 165.1 Purchase obligations(2) 10.2 4.1 1.7 16.0 Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 11.8 2.1 13.9 Total contractual obligations(3)(4) $ 92.7 $ 121.4 $ 85.5 $ 417.5 $ 717.1 (1) Represents contractual amounts due, including interest. (2) Represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchase goods or services. The agreements are enforceable and legally binding, and contain specific terms, including quantities to be purchased and the timing of the purchase. (3) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, other than capital lease obligations and other liabilities above. (4) We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $141.6 million, including interest and penalties, is not included in the table above. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, share based compensation, acquired technology, in process research and development, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets, and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of maintenance through independent maintenance renewals as well as, for certain new product offerings, management approved maintenance pricing which is evidenced by contractually stated maintenance renewal rates. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand alone basis. We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the longest expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is typically the longest maintenance term. In our time based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license fees in time based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years. Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and training services associated with our products, is derived under both time and material and fixed fee arrangements and in most instances is recognized on a proportional performance basis. If no discernable customer deliverable exists until the completion of the professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not involve significant production, modification, or customization of our software products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators (collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our products and services. In license arrangements with channel partners, title and risk of loss pass to the channel partners upon execution of our arrangements with them and the delivery of our products to the channel partner. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency. In our consolidated statements of operations, revenue is categorized as license, maintenance, and professional services revenue. We allocate fees from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these categories based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in the arrangements and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon managements best estimate of fair value for these elements and finally, apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Managements best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria. Capitalized Software Development Costs Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until the products general availability to customers in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86). Capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the products estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. We evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified. Determining net realizable value, as defined by SFAS No. 86, requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenue as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the Black Scholes option pricing model. We utilize Monte Carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of certain market performance based stock awards and the intrinsic value at the date of grant as an estimate of fair value for nonvested stock awards. The fair values of share based awards determined on the date of grant using a fair value model are impacted by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility and risk free rate over the expected term of the awards, as well as a set of peer companies expected stock price volatilities used in our Monte Carlo simulation models. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from market traded options for our stock, as we believe that the combined volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than either historical or implied volatility alone. We estimate the expected term of options granted using the simplified method allowed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 as amended by SAB No. 110, due to changes in vesting terms and contractual lives of our current options compared to our historical grants. We base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from United States Treasury issues with maturities similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense for those awards that are expected to vest. In addition, we estimate expected achievement of performance measures in determining the expected timing of vesting of our performance based nonvested stock awards. We record deferred tax assets for share based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of share based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. If we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Acquired Technology, In Process Research and Development, Goodwill and Intangible Assets When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology, in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values are primarily estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach, which requires us to project the related future revenue and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. We amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives. All goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value. When conducting impairment assessments, we are required to estimate future cash flows. The estimates used in valuing all intangible assets, including in process research and development, are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives. Incorrect 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in future impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Valuation of Investments Our investments consist of debt and equity securities. We account for our investments in debt securities and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We account for our investments in non marketable equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value under the cost method of accounting. We classify certain investments in debt securities as available for sale securities and certain investments in debt and equity securities as trading securities. We regularly analyze our portfolio of available for sale and cost method investments for other than temporary declines in fair value. This analysis requires significant judgment as well as the use of estimates and assumptions. The primary factors considered when determining if a charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary include whether: (i) the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis; (ii) the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated; (iii) if a debt security, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security; (iv) the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time; (v) if a debt security, such security has been downgraded by a rating agency; and (vi) we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities. However, from time to time, issuer specific and market specific events could warrant a write down for an other than temporary decline in fair value. As of March 31, 2009, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $72.2 million and an estimated fair value of $60.0 million. Our auction rate securities consist entirely of bonds issued by public agencies that are backed by student loans with at least a 97% guarantee by the federal government under the United States Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. Substantially all of these bonds are currently rated investment grade by Moodys or Standard and Poors. Auctions for these securities began failing in early 2008 and have continued to fail through April 2009, resulting in our continuing to hold such securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rates. We do not believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing the auction rate security investments have been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Due to the illiquidity in the auction rate securities market caused by failed auctions, we estimated the fair value of these securities using internally developed models of the expected cash flows of the securities which incorporated assumptions about the cash flows of the underlying student loans and discounts to reflect a lack of liquidity in the market for these securities. As the vast majority of our investments are investment grade securities, we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Investments in debt and equity securities with a fair value below our cost as of March 31, 2009 are discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current years results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements related entities and the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment. We are subject to corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 on April 1, 2007. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no United States taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide United States federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defined fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to April 1, 2009 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 relating to assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis on April 1, 2008. The adoption of the required provisions of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 with regard to non financial assets and non financial liabilities beginning in fiscal 2010. The adoption of these provisions is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to elect to measure at fair value eligible financial instruments that are not currently measured at fair value. This election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once made. SFAS No. 159 was effective for us as of April 1, 2008. The only financial instrument we have elected to measure at fair value under this statement is the put option we received in November 2008 to sell certain student loan related auction rate securities, as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources section herein. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), which changes the accounting for business combinations including: (i) the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, (ii) the recognition of contingent consideration, (iii) the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, (iv) the recognition of capitalized in process research and development, (v) the accounting for acquisition related restructuring costs, (vi) the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, and (vii) the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our financial position or results of operations will be dependent upon the nature and terms of business combinations that we may consummate in fiscal 2010 and thereafter. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS 161 applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). It requires entities to provide greater transparency regarding: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We adopted SFAS No. 161 for the year ended March 31, 2009. Because SFAS No. 161 applies only to financial statement disclosures, it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142 3 is effective for our financial statements beginning in fiscal 2010, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Based on our current operations, we do not expect that the adoption of FSP FAS 142 3 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 06 1), which clarifies that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive non forfeitable dividends are participating securities and provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities to allow computation of basic earnings per share using the two class method. FSP EITF 03 06 1 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and is not expected to have a material impact on our computation of earnings per share. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157 4 Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. This FSP provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 when the volume or level of activity in a market for an asset or liability has decreased significantly. This FSP also provides additional guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly (i.e., a forced liquidation or distressed sale). This FSP is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 115 2 and SFAS 124 2 Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments. The guidance applies to investments in debt securities for which other than temporary impairments may be recorded. If an entitys management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, then an entity may separate other than temporary impairments into two components: 1) the amount related to credit losses (recorded in earnings) and 2) all other amounts (recorded in other comprehensive income). This FSP is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 107 1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. This FSP amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. This FSP is effective for us in our first quarter fiscal 2010 interim financial statements. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of changes in interest rates on our investments and long term debt and changes in market prices of our debt and equity securities. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. The hypothetical changes noted in the sections immediately below are based on sensitivity analyses performed as of March 31, 2009. Actual results could differ materially. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We use derivatives to hedge those current net assets and liabilities that, when re measured in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, impact our consolidated statement of operations. Currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs. All forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing exposure, not for speculation or trading purposes. Gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge, resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures. When hedging balance sheet exposures, all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income (loss) in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur. All gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. If we did not hedge against foreign exchange rate movement, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately $17.5 million. This amount represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the United States Dollar. We do not currently hedge currency risk related to anticipated revenue or expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Interest Rate Risk We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principal concern is the preservation of liquid funds. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $1.2 billion at March 31, 2009, which consisted of $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the remaining balance consisting primarily of different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, we classify most of our investments as available for sale under SFAS No. 115, which provides that no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in annual interest rates would result in an approximate $11.7 million increase in earnings before taxes related to our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Market Risk The carrying value and fair value of our Notes as of March 31, 2009, were $298.4 million and $275.1 million, respectively. The fair value was based upon market prices of our Notes. If market interest rates increased by 100 basis points and assuming all other variables were held constant, we estimate the fair value of our Notes would decrease by approximately $16.5 million. As of March 31, 2009, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $72.2 million and an estimated fair value of $60.0 million. For further information, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above in 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary impairments in the future if market conditions were to persist and we are unable to recover the cost of our auction rate securities.
