ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations data in this MD&A are presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Additionally, in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations, certain non GAAP financial measures including non GAAP operating income, non GAAP net earnings and non GAAP diluted earnings per share are provided in this MD&A. See Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations below for an explanation of our use of non GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Overview Our fiscal 2010 financial performance in terms of revenue, operating income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flows was in line with our annual expectations. Select operating metrics for fiscal 2010 included: Total bookings, which represents the contract value of new transactions that we closed and recorded, was $1,946.4 million, representing an increase of $66.0 million, or 3.5%, over fiscal 2009. On a year over year basis, this increase was reflective of a $132.6 million, or 13.4%, increase in bookings in the second half of our fiscal year, offset by a $66.6 million, or 7.5%, decrease in bookings in the first half of our fiscal year. The year over year bookings increase in the second half of our fiscal year was attributable to bookings increases in our MSM and ESM segments of $76.2 million, or 19.9%, and $56.4 million, or 9.3%, respectively, while the year over year bookings decrease in the first half of our fiscal year was attributable primarily to a $65.4 million, or 12.3%, decrease in our ESM segment. Total revenue was $1,911.2 million, representing an increase of $39.3 million, or 2.1%, over fiscal 2009. This increase was reflective of license and maintenance revenue increases of $48.7 million, or 6.9%, and $5.9 million, or 0.6%, respectively, offset by a decrease in professional services revenue of $15.3 million, or 10.6%. On a segment basis, total MSM revenue increased by $23.7 million, or 3.2%, and total ESM revenue increased by $15.6 million, or 1.4%, over fiscal 2009. Operating income was $506.1 million, representing an increase of $138.3 million, or 37.6%, over fiscal 2009. Non GAAP operating income was $674.5 million, representing an increase of $62.2 million, or 10.2%, over fiscal 2009. Net earnings was $406.1 million, representing an increase of $168.0 million, or 70.6%, over fiscal 2009. Non GAAP net earnings was $496.0 million, representing an increase of $64.8 million, or 15.0%, over fiscal 2009. Diluted earnings per share was $2.17, representing an increase of $0.92, or 73.6%, over fiscal 2009. Non GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing an increase of $0.39, or 17.2%, over fiscal 2009. Cash flows from operations were $635.4 million, representing an increase of $55.7 million, or 9.6%, over fiscal 2009. We closed out the year with a strong balance sheet at March 31, 2010, including $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. 24 Table of Contents We continue to invest internally and externally to enhance our technology leadership, including in the areas of cloud computing, virtualization and software as a service. Select initiatives in fiscal 2010 included: We released multiple significant new product enhancements in each of our businesses, including significant new releases of our service automation, service assurance and service support solutions in our ESM business and new MSM solutions to support IBMs IMS V11 high performance application and data server; We completed two strategic acquisitions in our ESM business and one in our MSM business for total purchase consideration of $94.3 million; and We announced multiple new on demand SaaS offerings that leverage our IT service desk leadership through new distribution channels. We also continue to enhance shareholder value by returning cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for a total value of $275.1 million. Additionally, in April 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase stock. It is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term and we plan a portion of our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenue. In addition, a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter and, therefore, we generally do not know whether revenue has met our expectations until after the end of the quarter. If a shortfall in revenue were to occur in any given quarter, there would be an immediate, and possibly significant, impact to our overall earnings and, most likely, our stock price. Because our software solutions are designed for and marketed to companies looking to improve the management of their IT infrastructure and processes, demand for our products, and therefore our financial results, are dependent upon corporations continuing to value such solutions and to invest in such technology. There are a number of trends that have historically influenced demand for IT management software, including, among others, business demands placed on IT, computing capacity within IT departments, complexity of IT systems and IT operational costs. Our financial results are also influenced by many economic and industry conditions, including, but not limited to, general economic and market conditions in the United States and other economies in which we market products, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, general levels of corporate spending, IT budgets, the competitiveness of the IT management software and solutions industry, the adoption rate for BSM and the stability of the mainframe market. Acquisitions We have consummated multiple acquisitions of businesses in recent years. Each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates. Fiscal 2010 Acquisitions During fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisitions of MQSoftware, a leading provider of middleware and enterprise application transaction management software, Tideway Systems, a leading provider of IT discovery solutions, and Phurnace Software, a leading developer of software that automates the deployment and configuration of business critical Java EE applications, for combined purchase consideration of $94.3 million. Fiscal 2009 Acquisition In April 2008, we acquired BladeLogic, a leading provider of data center automation software, through the successful completion of a tender offer for approximately $834 million in cash, excluding acquisition costs. The BladeLogic acquisition expands our offerings for server provisioning, application release management, as well as configuration automation and compliance. 25 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions During fiscal 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ProactiveNet, RealOps, and Emprisa Networks for total cash consideration of $117.4 million including direct acquisition costs. ProactiveNet is a provider of an advanced early warning system for the IT market. This acquisition advances the solutions available for our customers looking to align IT services to business priorities. RealOps is a leading provider of run book automation software. This acquisition enables us to provide a robust platform for IT process design and execution. Emprisa is a leading provider of network configuration automation software. This acquisition expands our ability to include the configuration of network devices in our service automation offering. Historical Information Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings will be sustained at these levels. For a discussion of factors affecting operating results, see the Risk Factors section above.

License revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $48.7 million, or 6.9%, over fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable to license revenue increases in both our MSM and ESM segments, as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue in fiscal 2010 that was deferred in prior periods increased by $66.3 million over fiscal 2009. Of the license revenue transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront declined slightly to 48% for fiscal 2010 as compared to 50% in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, we closed 129 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $358.6 million, compared with 135 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $364.3 million, in fiscal 2009. License revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $62.1 million, or 9.6%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a license revenue increase in the ESM segment, partially offset by a license revenue decrease in the MSM segment, as further discussed below. Recognition of license revenue in fiscal 2009 that was deferred in 27 Table of Contents prior periods increased by $25.7 million over fiscal 2008. Of the license revenue transactions recorded, the percentage of license revenue recognized upfront remained constant at 50% during fiscal 2009 and 2008. During fiscal 2009, we closed 135 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $364.3 million, compared with 94 transactions with license values over $1 million, with a total license value of $278.1 million, in fiscal 2008. ESM license revenue was $462.2 million, or 60.9%, $434.9 million, or 61.3%, and $349.3 million, or 53.9%, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. ESM license revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $27.3 million, or 6.3%, over fiscal 2009, primarily due to an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of upfront license revenue recognized in connection with new transactions. The decrease in upfront license revenue recognized in fiscal 2010 was attributable to a decrease in ESM license transaction bookings and a slightly higher percentage of license transaction bookings that were recognized ratably over the underlying contractual maintenance terms rather than as upfront revenue. ESM license revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $85.6 million, or 24.5%, over fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased demand for our BSM solutions, inclusive of incremental revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic in April 2008 and our fiscal 2008 acquisitions, as well as an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year, partially offset by an increase in the level of new license transactions with revenue being deferred into future periods. ESM license revenue contributed by BladeLogic products amounted to $57.5 million in fiscal 2009. MSM license revenue was $296.2 million, or 39.1%, $274.8 million, or 38.7%, and $298.3 million, or 46.1%, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. MSM license revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $21.4 million, or 7.8%, over fiscal 2009, primarily due to a fiscal 2010 increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue and an increase in the amount of upfront license revenue recognized in connection with new transactions. MSM license revenue in fiscal 2009 decreased $23.5 million, or 7.9%, from fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of new license transactions executed, partially offset by an increase in the recognition of previously deferred license revenue year over year. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our recognized license revenue was impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Deferrals of license revenue $ (398.9 ) $ (383.2 ) $ (347.2 ) Recognition from deferred license revenue 390.5 324.2 298.5 Impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes (4.9 ) 3.5 (2.3 ) Net increase in deferred license revenue $ (13.3 ) $ (55.5 ) $ (51.0 ) Deferred license revenue balance at end of year $ 624.2 $ 610.9 $ 555.4 The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include, but are not limited to, customer transactions that include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices, certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights, time based licenses that are recognized over the term of the arrangement, customer transactions that include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and or professional services. The contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arms length negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenue as we expand our offerings to meet customers product, pricing and licensing needs. Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we recognize such license revenue either 28 Table of Contents ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable, and our total license revenue to be recognized each quarter becomes more predictable as a larger percentage of that revenue comes from the deferred license revenue balance. At March 31, 2010, the deferred license revenue balance was $624.2 million. As additional license revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. Estimated deferred license revenue that we expect to recognize in future periods at March 31, 2010 is (in millions): Fiscal 2011 $ 319.0 Fiscal 2012 173.7 Fiscal 2013 and thereafter 131.5 $ 624.2 Software Maintenance Revenue Maintenance revenue was $1,023.7 million, $1,017.8 million and $967.7 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6%, over fiscal 2009, and in fiscal 2009 increased by $50.1 million, or 5.2%, over fiscal 2008. These increases were attributable to increases in both ESM and MSM maintenance revenue, as discussed below. ESM maintenance revenue was $550.9 million, or 53.8%, $547.3 million, or 53.8%, and $514.2 million, or 53.1%, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. ESM maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $3.6 million, or 0.7%, over fiscal 2009, and in fiscal 2009 increased by $33.1 million, or 6.4%, over fiscal 2008. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed ESM customer license base, including incremental maintenance revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic in April 2008. Maintenance revenue contributed by BladeLogic products was $17.3 million in fiscal 2009. MSM maintenance revenue was $472.8 million, or 46.2%, $470.5 million, or 46.2%, and $453.5 million, or 46.9%, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. MSM maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $2.3 million, or 0.5%, over fiscal 2009, and in fiscal 2009 increased by $17.0 million, or 3.7%, over fiscal 2008. These year over year increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our installed MSM customer license base and increasing capacities of the current installed base. At March 31, 2010, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,179.6 million. As new customers are added and or current contracts are renewed and additional maintenance revenue is deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. Estimated deferred maintenance revenue that we expect to recognize in future periods at March 31, 2010 is (in millions): Fiscal 2011 $ 637.6 Fiscal 2012 304.0 Fiscal 2013 and thereafter 238.0 $ 1,179.6 29 Table of Contents Domestic vs. International Revenue Year Ended March 31, Percentage Change 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) License: Domestic $ 390.3 $ 361.7 $ 306.2 7.9 % 18.1 % International 368.1 348.0 341.4 5.8 % 1.9 % Total license revenue 758.4 709.7 647.6 6.9 % 9.6 % Maintenance: Domestic 561.4 555.5 525.5 1.1 % 5.7 % International 462.3 462.3 442.2 4.5 % Total maintenance revenue 1,023.7 1,017.8 967.7 0.6 % 5.2 % Professional services: Domestic 59.8 62.8 47.1 (4.8 )% 33.3 % International 69.3 81.6 69.2 (15.1 )% 17.9 % Total professional services revenue 129.1 144.4 116.3 (10.6 )% 24.2 % Total revenue $ 1,911.2 $ 1,871.9 $ 1,731.6 2.1 % 8.1 % We estimate that the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international revenue resulted in an approximate $3.3 million increase in total fiscal 2010 revenue as compared to fiscal 2009 and an approximate $9.0 million reduction in total fiscal 2009 revenue as compared to fiscal 2008, on a constant currency basis. Domestic License Revenue Domestic license revenue was $390.3 million, or 51.5%, $361.7 million, or 51.0%, and $306.2 million, or 47.3%, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Domestic license revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $28.6 million, or 7.9%, over fiscal 2009, due to a $15.8 million increase in MSM license revenue and a $12.8 million increase in ESM license revenue. Domestic license revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $55.5 million, or 18.1%, over fiscal 2008, due to a $66.2 million increase in ESM license revenue, including incremental license revenue of $40.5 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, offset by a $10.7 million decrease in MSM license revenue. International License Revenue International license revenue was $368.1 million, or 48.5%, $348.0 million, or 49.0%, and $341.4 million, or 52.7%, of our total license revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. International license revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $20.1 million, or 5.8%, over fiscal 2009, due to a $14.6 million increase in ESM license revenue and a $5.5 million increase in MSM license revenue. The ESM license revenue increase was attributable to a $10.4 million increase in our Asia Pacific market and a $6.5 million increase in our Canada market, partially offset by a combined $2.3 million net decrease in our other international markets. The MSM license revenue increase was attributable primarily to increases of $4.5 million and $1.3 million in our Latin America and Canada markets, respectively, partially offset by a net decrease of $0.3 million in our other international markets. 30 Table of Contents International license revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $6.6 million, or 1.9%, over fiscal 2008, due to a $19.4 million increase in ESM license revenue, including incremental license revenue of $17.0 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, offset by a $12.8 million decrease in MSM license revenue. The ESM license revenue increase was attributable to a $15.5 million increase in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) market, principally due to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $6.0 million increase in our Asia Pacific market, partially offset by a $2.1 million net decrease in our other international markets. The MSM license revenue decrease was attributable primarily to decreases of $7.2 million and $5.7 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively. Domestic Maintenance Revenue Domestic maintenance revenue was $561.4 million, or 54.8%, $555.5 million, or 54.6%, and $525.5 million, or 54.3%, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Domestic maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by $5.9 million, or 1.1%, over fiscal 2009, due to a $5.7 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue and a $0.2 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue. Domestic maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $30.0 million, or 5.7%, over fiscal 2008, due to a $22.9 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue, including incremental maintenance revenue of $14.1 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $7.1 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue. International Maintenance Revenue International maintenance revenue was $462.3 million, or 45.2%, $462.3 million, or 45.4%, and $442.2 million, or 45.7%, of our total maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. International maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 was flat with fiscal 2009, due to a $3.5 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue, offset by a $3.5 million decrease in MSM maintenance revenue. The ESM maintenance revenue increase was attributable to increases of $2.2 million and $1.3 million in our Asia Pacific and Canada markets, respectively. The MSM maintenance revenue decrease was attributable to a $9.1 million decrease in our EMEA market, partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million in our Latin America market and a $2.4 million combined net increase in our other international markets. International maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $20.1 million, or 4.5%, over fiscal 2008, due to a $10.2 million increase in ESM maintenance revenue, including incremental ESM maintenance revenue of $3.2 million resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $9.9 million increase in MSM maintenance revenue. The ESM maintenance revenue increase was attributable primarily to increases of $9.2 million and $1.1 million in our EMEA and Asia Pacific markets, respectively. The MSM maintenance revenue increase was attributable to increases of $7.1 million and $4.5 million in our EMEA and Latin American markets, respectively, partially offset by a $1.7 million net decrease in our other international markets. Professional Services Revenue Professional services revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by $15.3 million, or 10.6%, from fiscal 2009, which is reflective of a $3.0 million, or 4.8%, decrease in domestic professional services revenue and a $12.3 million, or 15.1%, decrease in international professional services revenue. These decreases were attributable to decreases in implementation, consulting and education services revenue period over period. Professional services revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $28.1 million, or 24.2%, over fiscal 2008, which is reflective of a $15.7 million, or 33.3%, increase in domestic professional services revenue and a $12.4 million, or 17.9%, increase in international professional services revenue. These increases were attributable to increases in implementation and consulting services, principally related to growth in BSM solution sales and inclusive of incremental professional services revenue resulting from our acquisition of BladeLogic in fiscal 2009. 31 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Percentage Change Year Ended March 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Cost of license revenue $ 115.5 $ 117.1 $ 100.4 (1.4 )% 16.6 % Cost of maintenance revenue 158.3 166.3 168.9 (4.8 )% (1.5 )% Cost of professional services revenue 137.4 141.6 125.1 (3.0 )% 13.2 % Selling and marketing expenses 556.2 541.5 527.4 2.7 % 2.7 % Research and development expenses 195.6 222.0 209.4 (11.9 )% 6.0 % General and administrative expenses 206.4 197.7 209.4 4.4 % (5.6 )% In process research and development 50.3 4.0 (100.0 )% * Amortization of intangible assets 32.7 34.1 14.8 (4.1 )% 130.4 % Severance, exit costs and related charges 3.0 33.5 14.7 (91.0 )% 127.9 % Total operating expenses $ 1,405.1 $ 1,504.1 $ 1,374.1 (6.6 )% 9.5 % * not meaningful We estimate that the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international operating expenses resulted in an approximate $5.4 million reduction in fiscal 2010 operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2009 and an approximate $28.0 million reduction in fiscal 2009 operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2008, on a constant currency basis. Cost of License Revenue Cost of license revenue consists primarily of the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed products, the amortization of acquired technology for products acquired through business combinations, license based royalties to third parties and production and distribution costs for initial product licenses. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, cost of license revenue was $115.5 million, or 6.0%, $117.1 million, or 6.3%, and $100.4 million, or 5.8%, of total revenue, respectively, and 15.2%, 16.5% and 15.5% of license revenue, respectively. Cost of license revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by $1.6 million, or 1.4%, from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable primarily due to the reduction in amortization of acquired technology in connection with earlier acquisitions that became fully amortized, partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired technology in connection with fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 acquisitions. Cost of license revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $16.7 million, or 16.6%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable primarily to a $16.9 million increase in the amortization of acquired technology related to fiscal 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. Cost of Maintenance Revenue Cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with customer support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance, enhancement and support services to our customers. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, cost of maintenance revenue was $158.3 million, or 8.3%, $166.3 million, or 8.9%, and $168.9 million, or 9.8%, of total revenue, respectively, and 15.5%, 16.3% and 17.5% of maintenance revenue, respectively. Cost of maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by $8.0 million, or 4.8%, from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $2.9 million reduction in personnel and related costs, including third party subcontracting fees, and a $1.3 million decrease in facility cost allocations, both associated with a decrease in 32 Table of Contents resources dedicated to maintenance projects and a year over year decrease in customer support headcount, a $1.4 million decrease in share based compensation expense and a net $2.4 million decrease in other expenses. Cost of maintenance revenue in fiscal 2009 decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.5%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in third party outsourcing costs and a $0.8 million net decrease in other expenses. Cost of Professional Services Revenue Cost of professional services revenue consists primarily of salaries, related personnel costs and third party fees associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our customers and the related infrastructure to support this business. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, cost of professional services revenue was $137.4 million, or 7.2%, $141.6 million, or 7.6%, and $125.1 million, or 7.2%, of total revenue, respectively, and 106.4%, 98.1% and 107.6% of professional services revenue, respectively. Cost of professional services revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by $4.2 million, or 3.0%, from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable primarily to a $9.8 million decrease in third party subcontracting fees, offset by a $5.8 million increase in professional services enablement personnel costs. Cost of professional services revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by $16.5 million, or 13.2%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable primarily to a $10.1 million increase in professional services enablement personnel costs, a $3.5 million increase in third party subcontracting fees and a $2.1 million increase in share based compensation expense. The increases in personnel and third party costs were associated primarily with a larger volume of BSM implementations, including incremental costs associated with our acquisition of BladeLogic. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, related personnel costs, sales commissions and costs associated with advertising, marketing, industry trade shows and sales seminars. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, selling and marketing expenses were $556.2 million, or 29.1%, $541.5 million, or 28.9%, and $527.4 million, or 30.5%, of total revenue, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2010 increased by $14.7 million, or 2.7%, over fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable to a $17.8 million increase in sales personnel costs, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense attributable to increased revenue as well as an increase in sales personnel headcount, and a $2.8 million increase in share based compensation expense, partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in marketing campaign expenditures and a net $0.9 million decrease in other expenses. Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2009 increased by $14.1 million, or 2.7%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to a $13.1 million increase in sales personnel costs, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense attributable to increased revenue and to our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $6.9 million increase in share based compensation expense, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in marketing campaign expenditures. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation, such as product manuals and installation guides. These expenses also include computer hardware and software costs, telecommunications costs and personnel costs associated with our development and production labs. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, research and development expenses were $195.6 million, or 10.2%, $222.0 million, or 11.9%, and $209.4 million, or 12.1%, of total revenue, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Research and development expenses in fiscal 2010 decreased by $26.4 million, or 11.9%, from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $13.4 million increase in research and development costs allocated to software development projects that were capitalized, a $6.3 million decrease in research and development personnel and related costs, including third party subcontracting fees, and a $5.2 million decrease in facility cost allocations, both associated primarily with lower average headcount levels and a higher percentage of headcount in lower cost regions, and a $2.8 million decrease in share based compensation expense, partially offset by a net increase of $1.3 million in other expenses. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 increased by $12.6 million, or 6.0%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable primarily to a $9.6 million increase in research and development personnel and related costs, resulting principally from our acquisition of BladeLogic, and a $2.5 million increase in share based compensation expense. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs of executive management, finance and accounting, facilities management, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses include fees paid for outside accounting and legal services, consulting projects and insurance. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, general and administrative expenses were $206.4 million, or 10.8%, $197.7 million, or 10.6%, and $209.4 million, or 12.1%, of total revenue, respectively. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 increased by $8.7 million, or 4.4%, over fiscal 2009. This increase was attributable to a $6.7 million increase in share based compensation expense and a $2.0 million net increase in other expenses. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased by $11.7 million, or 5.6%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was attributable to a $10.8 million decrease in personnel and related costs and a $4.9 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in share based compensation expense and a $1.9 million net increase in other expenses. In Process Research and Development The amounts allocated to in process research and development (IPR&D) represent the estimated fair values, based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended, related to acquired core research and development projects that were incomplete and had neither reached technological feasibility nor been determined to have an alternative future use pending achievement of technological feasibility at the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2009, we expensed acquired IPR&D totaling $50.3 million in connection with our acquisition of BladeLogic. During fiscal 2008, we expensed IPR&D totaling $4.0 million in connection with our fiscal 2008 business acquisitions. Beginning in fiscal 2010, under the new accounting guidance for business combinations, acquired IPR&D is no longer immediately expensed upon acquisition, but rather is capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset and evaluated for impairment during the development period. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization of finite lived acquired technology and customer relationships in connection with acquisitions consummated in current and prior years. Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2010 decreased by $1.4 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable to a $4.5 million reduction in amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with earlier acquisitions that became fully amortized, partially offset by $3.1 million in additional amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with our fiscal 2010 and 2009 acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2009 increased by $19.3 million, or 130.4%, over fiscal 2008. This increase was attributable to $27.7 million in additional amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection 34 Table of Contents with our fiscal 2009 and 2008 acquisitions, partially offset by an $8.4 million reduction in amortization associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with earlier acquisitions that became fully amortized. Severance, Exit Costs and Related Charges We have undertaken various restructuring and process improvement initiatives in recent years through the realignment of resources to focus on growth areas and the simplification, standardization and automation of key business processes. Additionally, we undertook general workforce reductions in fiscal 2009 and 2010, principally as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Related to these collective actions, we recorded charges of $3.0 million, $33.5 million, and $14.7 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These expenses were attributable primarily to identified workforce reductions and associated cash separation packages paid or accrued by us. While we will reduce future operating expenses as a result of these actions, we anticipate that these reductions will be substantially offset by incremental personnel related expenses due to headcount growth in strategic areas. We will continue to evaluate additional actions that may be necessary in the future to achieve our business goals. Other Income (Loss), Net Other income (loss), net, consists primarily of interest earned, realized gains and losses on investments and interest expense on our Notes and capital leases. Other income (loss), net, for fiscal 2010 and 2009 was a loss of $1.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively. This change was attributable primarily to an increase of $9.8 million related to gains on investments in our deferred compensation program and the non recurrence of $8.4 million in charges related to the write down of certain non marketable equity investments in the prior year period, principally offset by a $15.0 million decrease in interest income resulting from lower average investment yields on a slightly higher average investment balance. Other income (loss), net, for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was a loss of $3.9 million and income of $76.9 million, respectively. This change was attributable to a $42.1 million decrease in interest income, resulting from lower average investment yields on lower average investment balances, a $15.9 million increase in interest expense related to our Notes issued in fiscal 2009, $8.4 million in charges related to the write down of certain non marketable equity investments, a $7.8 million increase in losses related to investments in our deferred compensation program, $5.3 million of expense from the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a $1.3 million net decrease in other items. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $98.1 million, $125.8 million and $120.8 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.5%, 34.6% and 27.8%, respectively. The effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the worldwide mix of consolidated earnings before taxes and our policy of indefinitely re investing earnings from certain low tax jurisdictions, additional accruals and changes in estimates related to our uncertain tax positions, benefits associated with income attributable to both domestic production activities and the extraterritorial income exclusion and prior to fiscal 2010, the non deductible write off of IPR&D expense associated with certain acquisitions. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $30.0 million associated with a settlement with the IRS related to prior year tax matters, resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 increased by 6.6% over fiscal 2008 as a result of our $50.3 million write off of IPR&D expense in connection with the BladeLogic acquisition, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Non GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose various non GAAP financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures. The primary non GAAP financial measures we focus on are: (i) non GAAP operating income, (ii) non GAAP net earnings, and (iii) non GAAP diluted earnings per share. Each of these financial measures 35 Table of Contents excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP financial measures exclude share based compensation expense; the amortization of intangible assets; charges related to IPR&D; severance, exit costs and related charges; as well as the related tax impacts of these items; and the impact of certain discrete tax items. Each of the non GAAP adjustments is described in more detail below. A reconciliation of each of these non GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is also included below. We believe that these non GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude amounts that BMC management and the Board of Directors do not consider part of operating results when assessing the performance of the organization and measuring the results of the Companys performance. We believe that inclusion of these non GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results. BMC management and the Board of Directors use these non GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Companys performance and for forecasting purposes, as well as the allocation of future capital investments, and they are key variables in determining management incentive compensation. Accordingly, we believe these non GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. While we believe that these non GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations associated with the use of these non GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. Items such as share based compensation expense; the amortization of intangible assets; charges related to IPR&D; severance, exit costs and related charges and certain discrete tax items that are excluded from our non GAAP financial measures can have a material impact on net earnings. As a result, these non GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net earnings, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by using these non GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures below. For a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP financial measures, the reasons why management uses these measures and the usefulness of these measures, see items (1) (6) below. Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Operating income: GAAP operating income $ 506.1 $ 367.8 $ 357.5 Share based compensation expense(1) 88.9 82.0 66.6 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 76.5 78.7 42.4 Severance, exit costs and related charges(3) 3.0 33.5 14.7 In process research and development(4) 50.3 4.0 Non GAAP operating income $ 674.5 $ 612.3 $ 485.2 36 Table of Contents Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net earnings: GAAP net earnings $ 406.1 $ 238.1 $ 313.6 Share based compensation expense(1) 88.9 82.0 66.6 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 76.5 78.7 42.4 Severance, exit costs and related charges(3) 3.0 33.5 14.7 In process research and development(4) 50.3 4.0 Provision for income taxes on above pre tax non GAAP adjustments(5) (48.5 ) (58.2 ) (41.8 ) Certain discrete tax items(6) (30.0 ) 6.8 Non GAAP net earnings $ 496.0 $ 431.2 $ 399.5 Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings per share*: GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 2.17 $ 1.25 $ 1.57 Share based compensation expense(1) 0.48 0.43 0.33 Amortization of intangible assets(2) 0.41 0.41 0.21 Severance, exit costs and related charges(3) 0.02 0.18 0.07 In process research and development(4) 0.26 0.02 Provision for income taxes on above pre tax non GAAP adjustments(5) (0.26 ) (0.31 ) (0.21 ) Certain discrete tax items(6) (0.16 ) 0.04 Non GAAP diluted earnings per share* $ 2.66 $ 2.27 $ 2.00 * Non GAAP diluted earnings per share is computed independently for each period presented. The sum of GAAP diluted earnings per share and non GAAP adjustments per share may not equal non GAAP diluted earnings per share due to rounding differences. (1) Share based compensation expense. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude the compensation expenses required to be recorded by GAAP for equity awards to employees and directors. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful in evaluating the Companys and our management teams and business units performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non GAAP financial measures, which exclude expenses related to share based compensation, because these costs are generally fixed at the time an award is granted, are then expensed over several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management once granted. Accordingly, our operational managers are evaluated based on the operating expenses exclusive of share based compensation expenses and including such charges would hamper investors ability to evaluate the performance of our management in the manner in which management evaluates performance. Accordingly, management and the Board of Directors do not consider these costs for purposes of evaluating the performance of the business, and they exclude such costs when evaluating the performance of the Company, our business units and management teams, including the determination of management incentive compensation, and when making decisions to allocate resources among business units. (2) Amortization of intangible assets. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets, which are included in cost of license revenue and amortization of intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful in evaluating the Companys and our management teams and business units performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non GAAP financial measures, which exclude amortization of intangible assets, because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, management and the Board of Directors do 37 Table of Contents not consider these costs for purposes of evaluating the performance of the business during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and they exclude such costs when evaluating the performance of the Company, our business units and management teams, including the determination of management incentive compensation, and when making decisions to allocate resources among business units. (3) Severance, exit costs and related charges. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude severance, exit costs and related charges, primarily consisting of severance costs associated with position eliminations and lease abandonment costs, and any subsequent changes in estimates. Management and the Board of Directors believe it is useful, when evaluating corporate and business unit performance during a particular time period, to review financial measures excluding these restructuring costs because corporate management is also evaluated, and various corporate resource allocation decisions are made, based on operating expenses exclusive of such charges. We believe that the inclusion of such charges would hinder investors ability to evaluate the performance of our business in the manner in which management evaluates corporate performance, and thus such charges are excluded from our non GAAP financial measures. (4) In process research and development. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude IPR&D charges recorded in prior year periods. These amounts represent the estimated fair value of core research and development projects that were incomplete as of the respective dates of acquisition and had neither reached technological feasibility nor been determined to have alternative future uses pending achievement of technological feasibility upon further development. Such amounts were required to be expensed by us as of the date of the respective acquisition under the accounting rules in place in prior years. Because the costs are fixed at the time of acquisition and are not subject to management influence, management does not consider these costs in evaluating the performance of the Company, our business units and management teams, including the determination of management incentive compensation, nor when it allocates resources among the business units. We believe excluding these items is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results without being affected by our acquisition history and the results of other companies in our industry, which have their own unique acquisition histories. (5) Provision for income taxes on above pre tax non GAAP adjustments. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude the tax impact of the above pre tax non GAAP adjustments. This amount is calculated using the tax rates of each country to which these pre tax non GAAP adjustments relate. Management excludes the non GAAP measures on a net of tax basis in evaluating our performance. Therefore, we exclude the tax impact of these charges when presenting non GAAP financial measures. (6) Certain discrete tax items. Our non GAAP financial measures exclude: (i) in fiscal 2010, a $30.0 million net tax benefit associated with an IRS settlement related to prior year tax matters, and (ii) in fiscal 2009, $6.8 million of tax expense associated with an intercompany transfer of IPR&D in connection with the acquisition of BladeLogic. Management excludes the impact of these items when evaluating the performance of the Company, our business units and management teams, including the determination of management incentive compensation, and when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, we exclude these items when presenting non GAAP financial measures. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2010, we had $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, approximately 42% of which was held by our international subsidiaries and was largely generated from our international operations. Our international operations have generated $318.6 million of earnings that we have determined will be invested indefinitely in those operations. Were such earnings to be repatriated, we would incur a United States federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements. We also had outstanding letters of credit, performance bonds and similar instruments related to various customer, facilities and other obligations at March 31, 2010 of approximately $43.6 million. 38 Table of Contents At March 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $67.3 million, of which securities with a par value of $50.7 million were classified as available for sale and a par value of $16.6 million were classified as trading. The total estimated fair value was $60.5 million and $60.0 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our auction rate securities consist entirely of bonds issued by public agencies that are backed by student loans with at least a 97% guarantee by the federal government under the United States Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. All of these bonds are currently rated investment grade by Moodys or Standard and Poors. Auctions for these securities began failing in early 2008 and have continued to fail, resulting in our continuing to hold such securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rates. We do not believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing the auction rate security investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on our current ability to access cash and other short term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and other sources of cash that we expect to be available, we do not anticipate the recent lack of liquidity of these investments to have a material impact on our business strategy, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, in November 2008, we entered into a put agreement with a bank from which we have acquired certain auction rate securities with a remaining par value of $16.6 million and an estimated fair value of $15.5 million at March 31, 2010. Under the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to put these auction rate securities to the bank at par value at any time during the period beginning June 30, 2010 and ending June 30, 2012. The bank also has the right to repurchase these auction rate securities at par value on or before June 30, 2010. We believe that our existing cash and investment balances and funds generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. We may elect to use available cash and investments to fund such activities in the future. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source (i.e., cash held in the United States versus international locations), the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital. We may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire securities, including outstanding borrowings and equity securities, in open market repurchases, unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as will comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and contractual restrictions, if applicable. The amount of repurchases, which is subject to management discretion, may be material and may change from period to period. Our cash flows during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were: Year Ended March 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 635.4 $ 579.7 $ 593.7 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (159.3 ) (851.9 ) 221.4 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (158.7 ) 57.4 (438.2 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 27.9 (50.2 ) 27.9 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 345.3 $ (265.0 ) $ 404.8 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 increased by $55.7 million from fiscal 2009, attributable primarily to an increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, 39 Table of Contents amortization, share based compensation expense and IPR&D), partially offset by the net impact of working capital changes. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2009 decreased by $14.0 million from fiscal 2008, attributable primarily to a net reduction in cash receipts on our receivables, offset by a net increase in net earnings before non cash expenses (principally depreciation, amortization, share based compensation expense and IPR&D) and other working capital changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 decreased by $692.6 million from fiscal 2009. This decrease was attributable primarily to cash expended in the prior year period for our acquisition of BladeLogic and a year over year increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by a year over year increase in investment purchases. Net cash used in investing activities was $851.9 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $221.4 million in fiscal 2008. This difference was attributable primarily to cash expended in fiscal 2009 for our acquisition of BladeLogic and a year over year decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, partially offset by year over year decreases in investment purchases and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 was $158.7 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $57.4 million in fiscal 2009. This difference was attributable primarily to a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings related primarily to the issuance of our Notes in the prior year period, partially offset by a year over year decrease in treasury stock purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $57.4 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $438.2 million in fiscal 2008. This difference was attributable primarily to net proceeds received related to the issuance of our Notes in fiscal 2009 and a year over year decrease in treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises, an increase in stock repurchases to satisfy withholding obligations and an increase in payments under borrowing and capital lease obligations. Finance Receivables We provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness. Our practice of providing financing at reasonable market interest rates enhances our competitive position. We participate in established programs with third party financial institutions and sell a significant portion of our finance receivables to such institutions on a non recourse basis, enabling us to collect cash sooner and fully transfer credit risk of customer default to third party financial institutions. We record transfers of finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables (including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors) and when we do not have significant continuing involvement in the generation of cash flows due the financial institutions. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we transferred $208.8 million, $149.7 million and $267.5 million, respectively, of such receivables through these programs. Treasury Stock Purchased Our Board of Directors had previously authorized a total of $3.0 billion to repurchase common stock. During fiscal 2010, we purchased 7.5 million shares for $275.1 million. From the inception of the stock repurchase authorization through March 31, 2010, we have purchased 122.3 million shares for $2.9 billion. At March 31, 2010, there was $69.8 million remaining in the stock repurchase program, which does not have an expiration date. In April 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion to repurchase stock. In addition, during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 0.4 million shares for $13.0 million to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon the lapse of restrictions on nonvested stock grants. The repurchase of stock will continue to be funded primarily with cash generated from domestic operations and, therefore, affects our overall domestic versus international liquidity balances. 40 Table of Contents See Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities above for a monthly detail of treasury stock purchases for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at March 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After5 Years Total (In millions) Senior unsecured notes(1) $ 21.8 $ 43.5 $ 43.5 $ 368.8 $ 477.6 Capital lease obligations(1) 8.3 6.0 1.9 16.2 Operating lease obligations 39.2 56.5 32.5 14.0 142.2 Purchase obligations(2) 14.4 8.8 0.1 23.3 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(1) 15.5 25.8 12.2 53.5 Total contractual obligations(3)(4) $ 99.2 $ 140.6 $ 90.2 $ 382.8 $ 712.8 (1) Represents contractual amounts due, including interest. (2) Represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchase goods or services. The agreements are enforceable and legally binding, and contain specific terms, including quantities to be purchased and the timing of the purchase. (3) Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, other than capital lease obligations and other long term liabilities above. (4) We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $144.1 million, including interest and penalties, is not included in the table above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an on going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, capitalized software development costs, share based compensation, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. As substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have 41 Table of Contents established VSOE of the fair value of maintenance through independent maintenance renewals as well as, for certain new product offerings, management approved maintenance pricing which is evidenced by contractually stated maintenance renewal rates. These demonstrate a consistent relationship of pricing maintenance as a percentage of either the net license fee or the discounted or undiscounted license list price. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand alone basis. We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include multiple software products for which the associated maintenance pricing is based on a combination of undiscounted license list prices, net license fees or discounted license list prices. We are also unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include unlimited licensing rights and certain arrangements that contain rights to future unspecified software products as part of the maintenance offering. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value exists for all remaining undelivered elements, or if the deferral is due to the factors described above, license revenue is recognized ratably over the longest expected delivery period of undelivered elements in the arrangement, which is typically the longest maintenance term. In our time based license agreements, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for undelivered maintenance elements because the contractual maintenance terms in these arrangements are the same duration as the license terms and VSOE of fair value of maintenance cannot be established. Accordingly, license fees in time based license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the terms of the maintenance arrangements, which primarily range from one to three years. Professional services revenue, which principally relates to implementation, integration and training services associated with our products, is derived under both time and material and fixed fee arrangements and in most instances is recognized on a proportional performance basis. If no discernable customer deliverable exists until the completion of the professional services, we apply the completed performance method and defer the recognition of professional services revenue until completion of the services, which is typically evidenced by a signed completion letter from the customer. Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license elements because they do not involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of such products. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license elements, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method. We also execute arrangements through resellers, distributors and systems integrators (collectively, channel partners) in which the channel partners act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our products and services. In license arrangements with channel partners, title and risk of loss pass to the channel partners upon execution of our arrangements with them and the delivery of our products to the channel partner. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners on a net basis (the amount actually received by us from the channel partners) when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. Revenue from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment, as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions. In arrangements where the fees are not considered to be fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement. If we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or a risk of concession exists, we do not recognize revenue in excess of the amount of cash received. 42 Table of Contents We are required to charge certain taxes on our revenue transactions. These amounts are not included in revenue. Instead, we record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency. In our consolidated statements of operations, revenue is categorized as license, maintenance and professional services revenue. We allocate revenue from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these categories based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenue to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon managements best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Managements best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria. Capitalized Software Development Costs Costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Thereafter, software development costs are capitalized until the products general availability to customers in accordance with accounting standards. Judgment is involved in determining the point at which technological feasibility is reached. If different judgments were made, they could result in a different amount of costs that are capitalized. Capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the products estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers. We evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product. Any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter in which it is identified. Determining net realizable value requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off, if any. Actual amounts realized from the sales of software products could differ from our estimates. Also, any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenue as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs. Share Based Compensation Share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the Black Scholes option pricing model. We utilize Monte Carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of certain market performance based stock awards and the intrinsic value at the date of grant as an estimate of fair value for nonvested stock awards. The fair values of share based awards determined on the date of grant using a fair value model are impacted by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility and risk free interest rate over the expected term of the awards, as well as a set of peer companies expected stock price volatilities used in our Monte Carlo simulation models. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from market traded options for our stock, as we believe that the combined volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than either historical or implied volatility alone. We estimate the expected term of options granted using the simplified method allowed by relevant accounting standards, due to changes in vesting terms and contractual lives of our current options compared to our historical grants. We base 43 Table of Contents the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from United States Treasury issues with maturities similar to the expected term of the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate prevesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense for those awards that are expected to vest. In addition, we estimate expected achievement of performance measures in determining the expected timing of vesting of our performance based nonvested stock awards. We record deferred tax assets for share based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of share based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. If we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships. The excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date. The fair values are primarily estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach, which requires us to project the related future revenue and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. We amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives. All goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value. When conducting impairment assessments, we are required to estimate future cash flows. The estimates used in valuing all intangible assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives. Incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in future impairment charges and those charges could be material to our results of operations. Valuation of Investments Our investments consist of debt and equity securities. We classify our investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and all debt securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading at acquisition and reevaluate such classification at each subsequent balance sheet date. We do not have any investments classified as held to maturity at March 31, 2010 or 2009. Our investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless an impairment is considered to be other than temporary. Other than temporary unrealized losses on available for sale securities are generally recorded in gain (loss) on investments, net, in the consolidated statements of operations unless certain criteria are met. In addition, unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and all realized gains and losses are recorded in 44 Table of Contents gain (loss) on investments, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. We account for our investments in non marketable equity securities where we do not have significant influence and that do not have a readily determinable fair value under the cost method of accounting. We regularly analyze our portfolio of available for sale and cost method investments for other than temporary declines in fair value. This analysis requires significant judgment as well as the use of estimates and assumptions. The primary factors considered when determining if a charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary include whether: (i) the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis; (ii) the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated; (iii) if a debt security, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security; (iv) the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time; (v) if a debt security, such security has been downgraded by a rating agency; and (vi) whether we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. We have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities. However, from time to time, issuer specific and market specific events could warrant a write down for an other than temporary decline in fair value. At March 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $67.3 million and an estimated fair value of $60.5 million. Our auction rate securities consist entirely of bonds issued by public agencies that are backed by student loans with at least a 97% guarantee by the federal government under the United States Department of Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. All of these bonds are currently rated investment grade by Moodys or Standard and Poors. Auctions for these securities began failing in early 2008 and have continued to fail, resulting in our continuing to hold such securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rates. We do not believe that any of the underlying issuers of these auction rate securities are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing the auction rate security investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Due to the illiquidity in the auction rate securities market caused by failed auctions, we estimated the fair value of these securities using internally developed models of the expected cash flows of the securities which incorporate assumptions about the cash flows of the underlying student loans and estimates of the rate of return required by investors, which includes an adjustment to reflect a lack of liquidity in the market for these securities. As the vast majority of our investments are investment grade securities, we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Investments in debt and equity securities with a fair value below our cost at March 31, 2010 are discussed in greater detail in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Income Taxes Income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current years results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities and the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment. We are subject to corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no United States taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow, working 45 Table of Contents capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide United States federal taxes on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In July 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released the final version of its new Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the single authoritative source for GAAP. While not intended to change GAAP, the Codification significantly changed the way in which the accounting literature is organized, combining all authoritative standards into a comprehensive, topically organized database. All existing accounting standard documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the Codification is considered nonauthoritative, other than guidance issued by the SEC. The Codification was effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after September 15, 2009. We adopted the Codification in our interim financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance for estimating fair value when the volume or level of activity in a market for an asset or liability has decreased significantly. This guidance also provides information on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly (i.e., a forced liquidation or distressed sale). This guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance that applies to investments in debt securities for which other than temporary impairments may be recorded. If an entitys management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, then an entity may separate other than temporary impairments into two components: (i) the amount related to credit losses (recorded in earnings) and (ii) all other amounts (recorded in other comprehensive income). This guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance that requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. This guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010, and because it applies only to financial statement disclosures, it had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities and providing information on how to allocate earnings to participating securities to allow computation of basic and diluted earnings per share using the two class method. This guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and requires retrospective application for periods prior to the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our computation of earnings per share. In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance that amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. This guidance was effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 46 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued a revision to previously issued accounting literature which changes the accounting for business combinations including: (i) the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, (ii) the recognition of contingent consideration, (iii) the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, (iv) the recognition of capitalized IPR&D, (v) the accounting for acquisition related restructuring costs, (vi) the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, and (vii) the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. We began applying this guidance prospectively to all business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is dependent upon the nature and terms of business combinations that we consummate. In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of this standard to April 1, 2009 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). We adopted the new standard relating to assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis on April 1, 2008, and on April 1, 2009 with regard to non financial assets and non financial liabilities. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In October 2009, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance for arrangements that include both software and non software related deliverables. This guidance requires entities to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of VSOE or other third party evidence of the selling price. Additionally, the guidance modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 interim financial statements, with earlier adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, which amended previous GAAP literature. The amendment includes: (i) elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept, (ii) a new unit of account definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, (iii) clarifications and changes to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, (iv) a change to the amount of recognized gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor, and (v) extensive new disclosures. This guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2011 and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of changes in interest rates on our investments and long term borrowings and changes in market prices of our debt and equity securities. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments. The hypothetical changes noted in the sections immediately below are based on sensitivity analyses performed at March 31, 2010. Actual results could differ materially. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We use derivatives to hedge those current net assets and liabilities that, when re measured in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, impact our consolidated statement of operations. Foreign currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs. All foreign currency forward contracts entered 47 Table of Contents into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing exposure, not for speculation or trading purposes. Gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge, resulting in immaterial net gains or losses overall on the hedged exposures. When hedging balance sheet exposures, all gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other income (loss) in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur. All settlements of gains and losses related to foreign currency forward contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. If we did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in earnings before taxes of approximately $7.6 million. This amount represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the United States dollar. We do not currently hedge currency risk related to anticipated revenue or expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The notional amounts at contract exchange rates of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding were: Notional Amount March 31, 2010 2009 (In millions) Foreign Currency Forward Contracts (Receive United States dollar/pay foreign currency) Euro $ 98.2 $ 132.8 Brazilian real 24.9 3.6 Australian dollar 15.4 3.8 South Korean won 6.0 9.4 Chinese yuan renminbi 4.6 8.0 New Zealand dollar 4.5 2.5 Swiss franc 2.6 4.5 British pound 29.4 Other 14.7 19.5 Total $ 170.9 $ 213.5 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts (Pay United States dollar/receive foreign currency) Israeli shekel $ 78.0 $ Indian rupee 11.5 24.3 Mexican peso 1.5 11.5 Other 4.5 1.7 Total $ 95.5 $ 37.5 Interest Rate Risk We adhere to a conservative investment policy, whereby our principal concern is the preservation of liquid funds. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2010, which consisted of $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the remaining balance consisted primarily of different types of investment grade debt securities. Although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions, we classify most of our investments as available for sale, which provides that no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or any loss in value 48 Table of Contents was deemed to be other than temporary. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in annual interest rates would result in an approximate $15.0 million increase in earnings before taxes related to our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Market Risk The carrying value and fair value of our Notes at March 31, 2010, were $298.5 million and $338.1 million, respectively. The fair value was based upon market prices of our Notes. If market interest rates increased by 100 basis points and assuming all other variables were held constant, we estimate the fair value of our Notes would decrease by approximately $19.9 million. At March 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a par value of $67.3 million and an estimated fair value of $60.5 million. For further information, refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. We may incur additional temporary unrealized losses or other than temporary impairments in the future if current market conditions were to persist and we are unable to recover the cost of our auction rate securities.
