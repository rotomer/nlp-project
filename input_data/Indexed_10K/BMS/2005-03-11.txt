Generally about 65 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn care. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 80 percent of our net sales. The remaining 20 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. Market Conditions During 2004, higher petrochemical feedstock costs significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives, the primary raw materials for our business segments. Our business model has been developed to accommodate such cost increases by adjusting selling prices to reflect increased costs. In addition, we focus on marketing value added, unique materials and customer service that cannot be easily duplicated by our competition. During the year, we experienced increased customer demand for innovative packaging and pressure sensitive solutions, reflecting a strengthening economy and our customers focus on new product introductions. Restructuring and Related Charges During the third quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program in which three flexible packaging plants were closed. This program eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer, more efficient facilities. While most of the restructuring activities were completed as of December 31, 2003, gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net gain of $0.7 million during 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program for our pressure sensitive materials business segment to reduce capacity and fixed costs associated with our label materials product line. The majority of the restructuring activities were completed by the second quarter of 2004. Restructuring charges totaled $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $3.1 million in 2004. Acquisitions Our acquisitions strategy is growth oriented, focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies, access to new markets or product lines, or critical mass. Since the beginning of 2002, we have completed four such acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments. These four acquisitions have added about $275 million of net sales, about two thirds of which is from non U.S. manufacturing plants. Our non U.S. plants are focused on serving the flexible packaging needs of the geographic regions in which each plant resides. These acquisitions are more fully discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 26, 2004, Bemis and our Mexican joint venture partner completed the purchase of certain flexible packaging assets of Masterpak S.A. de C.V., including a converting facility in Tultitln, Mexico. These assets produce flexible packaging for dry foods, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, confectionery and bakery products. Annual sales related to the assets acquired were approximately $35 million. We own 51 percent of the acquired business, which will focus on supplying the packaging needs of Mexican food and consumer goods markets. On January 5, 2005, subsequent to year end 2004, we acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America with annual revenues in excess of $300 million. The acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of Dixie Toga in addition to 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock. The cash purchase price was approximately $250 million. This acquisition significantly increases our exposure to the growing South American packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region. Since 1998, Bemis and Dixie Toga have operated a joint venture in Brazil, known as Itap Bemis Ltda., and have established a successful working relationship. Dixie Toga has a strong regional management team, a business model similar to Bemis and growing, profitable operations. We expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on our financial results in 2005. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales increased 7.6 percent to $2.83 billion, compared to $2.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. Acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004 accounted for 1.1 percent of the 7.6 percent increase in net sales while currency translation accounted for 2.3 percent. Increased unit sales in both business segments drove a 3.1 percent increase in net sales during the year, while price and mix accounted for the remaining 1.1 percent increase. Demand for innovative packaging for a variety of food categories such as meat and cheese, frozen foods, confectionery products and snack foods led flexible packaging volumes, while technical products drove an increase in pressure sensitive materials. Net sales in 2003 increased 11.2 percent from net sales of $2.37 billion in 2002. Acquisitions accounted for 6.6 percent of the net sales growth, while currency translation accounted for about 3.0 percent. The remaining 1.6 percent sales growth reflects primarily the increased sales volumes in flexible packaging during 2003. Operating profit increased to $342.2 million in 2004 from $280.1 million in 2003 and $316.4 million in 2002. Operating profit in 2004 reflects a $5.6 million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant. In addition, restructuring and related charges included in operating profit totaled $2.4 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring charges, operating profit would have been $339.0 million for 2004, an increase of 14.3 9 percent from $296.7 million for 2003. There were no restructuring charges during 2002. Cost savings in 2004 resulting from the completed restructuring programs were partially offset by increased pension expense. Sales mix improvements resulted in increased operating profit during 2004. During 2003, competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive label materials, in addition to increases in certain resin costs, contributed to lower margins. Net income totaled $180.0 million in 2004, $147.1 million in 2003, and $165.5 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 for 2004, including restructuring and related charges of about $0.014 per share. Results for 2004 also reflect a gain of $0.032 per share on the sale of rotogravure plant assets during the fourth quarter of the year. For 2003, diluted earnings per share were $1.37, including restructuring and related charges of about $0.095 per share. Diluted earnings per share for 2002 totaled $1.54. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery, frozen foods, lawn and garden, personal care, beverages, medical devices, bakery and snack foods. These markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. During periods of unusual raw material cost volatility, selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs. During 2004, resin costs steadily increased, resulting in double digit percentage increases by year end. These raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices during the year. During 2003, polyethylene resin prices increased 30 percent during the first quarter in anticipation of natural gas shortages due to conflict in the Middle East and other international supply concerns. As concerns subsided in April, prices drifted back down, resulting in a volatile pricing period that delayed our ability to adjust selling prices, which negatively impacted 2003 operating margins. In July 2003, we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs, take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities. We closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of 2003, recording restructuring and related charges of $13.9 million during 2003. Of this total charge, $7.1 million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and was classified as costs of products sold. The remaining $6.8 million of charges included $5.0 million for employee severance and related costs and $1.8 million of other costs, primarily equipment relocation, all of which have been recorded as other costs (income), net. With the flexible packaging restructuring efforts essentially completed at December 31, 2003, the net restructuring gain of $0.7 million classified as other costs (income), net, in 2004 relates primarily to the sale of closed facilities offset by ongoing costs to maintain these closed facilities. Our flexible packaging business segment recorded net sales of $2.25 billion in 2004, a 7.1 percent increase from $2.10 billion in 2003. The acquisition of the flexible packaging assets of Masterpak, a Mexican joint venture investment made during the second quarter of 2004, contributed 0.8 percent sales growth. Currency translation accounted for a 1.8 percent increase in sales, primarily reflecting the impact of our exposure to the strengthening Euro. Strong unit sales to markets for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack foods, frozen foods, personal care products, cereal products and unitizing film for products such as bottled water was partially offset by lower unit sales to bakery, pet product and industrial markets. Price and mix increased sales by about 1.1 percent in total, as customers balanced price increases with changes in product mix. Net sales increased 12.3 percent in 2003 from $1.87 billion in 2002. Acquisitions accounted for an increase of 8.4 percent and currency translation accounted for 2.0 percent of the improvement from 2002. Operating profit increased to $308.3 million in 2004 compared to $263.8 million in 2003 and $289.1 million in 2002. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7 percent in 2004 compared to 12.6 percent in 2003. Operating profit was 15.5 percent in 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a gain of $5.6 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Florence, Kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities. Excluding the impact of both the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring charges, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 13.4 percent in 2004 compared to 13.2 percent in 2003. Savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation in 2004. In addition, operating losses from the newly acquired joint venture in Mexico totaled $3.7 million in 2004 where resolution of supplier issues and deferred maintenance activities related to the previous ownership is continuing. Factors that dampened flexible packaging operating profits in 2003 included increased employee pension and other benefit costs and unusual volatility in the price of polyethylene resin during the first half of the year. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, battery, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions have had a greater negative influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. During 2004, the increased cost of petrochemical products caused an associated increase in the cost of adhesive materials, in addition to a concern about availability of adhesive from suppliers. In response to these cost increases, we increased selling prices and secured alternative supplies of raw materials in case of shortages. We focused on margin expansion by introducing new product innovations and quality initiatives during the year. In addition, recent restructuring activities resulted in better capacity utilization in label products. In October of 2003, we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity. We closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization in our label products line. Restructuring and related charges of $2.7 million were recorded in 10 2003, of which $2.3 million related to severance and related charges and was recorded as other costs (income), net. The remaining $0.4 million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and related charges and was recorded as an element of costs of products sold. During 2004, restructuring and related charges totaling $3.1 million related primarily to the cost of closing a label products plant in Nevada. Of this total, $1.8 million related to costs and equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs (income), net, with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold. Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported net sales of $584.8 million in 2004, an increase of 9.5 percent from net sales of $534.1 million in 2003. An acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2003 of a graphic business in Europe increased net sales by 2.6 percent during 2004 and currency translation provided a 4.2 percent increase. About 44 percent of the sales from this business segment are from our manufacturing operations in Belgium, which benefited from the strengthening of the European currencies during 2004. Stronger unit sales of technical products more than offset slightly lower unit sales of label and graphic products compared to 2003. Price and mix provided a combined improvement to net sales during the year of about 1.0 percent. Net sales in 2003 increased 7.0 percent from $498.9 million in 2002, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro during 2003. Operating profit increased substantially in 2004 to $33.9 million or 5.8 percent of net sales, compared to $16.3 million or 3.1 percent of net sales in 2003, and $27.3 million or 5.5 percent of net sales in 2002. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, operating profit would have been $37.0 million or 6.3 percent of net sales in 2004, and $19.0 million or 3.6 percent of net sales in 2003. Currency translation contributed $2.2 million to operating profit in 2004 and $2.9 million in 2003. Improved profit levels in 2004 reflect improved sales mix and the savings associated with restructuring activities early in the year, partially offset by increased pension expense. During 2003, label product markets were very competitive, as reduced selling prices offset much of the benefits of improving production volume during the year. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased to 21.0 percent in 2004 compared to 20.2 percent in 2003. Gross margin was 22.3 percent in 2002. Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $1.1 million in 2004 and $7.6 million in 2003. Lower margins in 2004 reflect the impact of higher resin costs in advance of selling price increases and an increased proportion of lower margin non U.S. sales. We are implementing improvements in Europe and Mexico to increase profitability at those locations. During 2003, unusual volatility in raw material prices for flexible packaging products coupled with pricing pressure in markets for certain commodity like products caused margins to decline from 2002 levels. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.1 percent for 2004, compared to 9.7 percent for both 2003 and 2002. Total expenses were $285.0 million in 2004, $256.7 million in 2003, and $229.3 million in 2002. Increased expenses for 2004 reflect the larger sales organization associated with our global sales efforts and an increase from 2003 in broad based incentive compensation and pension expense. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased slightly in 2004 to $21.1 million compared to $21.5 million in 2003. Expenses in 2002 totaled $17.4 million. Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness and relevance of our research and developments activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense Substantially all of our outstanding debt for each of the three years presented was subject to variable interest rates. During 2004, short term interest rates increased gradually from about 1.1 percent at December 31, 2003 to about 2.3 percent at December 31, 2004. The impact of this increase in short term interest rates was partially offset by a $42.6 million decrease in outstanding debt during 2004. Interest expense increased in 2004 to $15.5 million compared to $12.6 million in 2003. During 2002, we recorded interest expense of $15.4 million, reflecting lower interest rates but higher outstanding debt levels. We expect interest expense to increase substantially in 2005 due to increasing short term interest rates and higher debt levels. On January 5, 2005, we acquired a Brazilian packaging company for which we assumed about $40 million in interest bearing debt and borrowed approximately $250 million to complete the acquisition. Other Costs (Income), Net We reported net other income of $20.1 million in 2004, reflecting a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility during the fourth quarter partially offset by restructuring and related charges of $1.2 million. Equity income from our Brazilian joint venture was $11.7 million in 2004, reflecting improved profitability in addition to an increase in our equity ownership from 33 percent to 45 percent in January 2004. The remainder of other income in 2004 is primarily interest income. During 2003, net other costs of $2.7 million included $8.9 million of restructuring and related charges related to employee severance and the closure of manufacturing facilities. The Brazilian joint venture accounted for $3.2 million of equity income during 2003. Net other income of $1.2 million in 2002 was primarily related to interest income. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 38.7 percent in 2004, 38.5 percent in 2003, and 38.0 percent in 2002. The difference between our overall tax rate and the U. S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. 11 Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Rating At year end the Company had long term credit ratings of A from Standard & Poors and A2 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A 1 and P 1 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. Our financial position and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. On January 5, 2005, we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of Dixie Toga S.A. for a cash price of approximately $250 million. The acquisition was initially financed with commercial paper. We intend to refinance a portion of our commercial paper during the first half of 2005. In July 2005, $100 million of existing public bonds will mature and we expect to refinance this debt with available commercial paper capacity. In conjunction with the January 2005 acquisition, the credit rating agencies have reviewed the ratings that they have assigned to our debt. Standard & Poors has confirmed their ratings of A and A 1 for our long term senior unsecured debt and commercial paper, respectively. On March 11, 2005, Moodys Investor Service reduced our long term senior unsecured debt credit rating to "Baa1" and reduced our commercial paper rating to "P 2." Sources of Liquidity Cash provided by operations was $271.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $311.1 million in 2003 and $286.7 million in 2002. Cash provided by operations in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $50 million and $40 million, respectively. While no contributions are required for 2005 or 2006, we continue to monitor the funded status of our U.S. pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity. Increased raw material costs during 2004 resulted in increased levels of working capital, which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during the second half of the year. In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $160 million. In early January 2005 the amount of outstanding commercial paper increased substantially as a direct result of the acquisition of Dixie Toga S.A. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility. In September 2004, we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to September of 2009. The previous credit facility included a Revolving Credit Agreement where the Company could borrow up to $334 million through August 2006. Our new credit facility provides $500 million of available financing supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. In addition to funds available under this credit facility, we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. Previously the Company had a 364 day Credit Agreement under which the Company could borrow up to $250 million. If these new credit facilities and ECNs were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Long term Debt Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up credit agreement expires in 2009. In July 2005, public bonds totaling $100 million will mature. We intend to refinance those bonds with commercial paper. Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $134.5 million during 2004, compared to $106.5 million in 2003 and $91.0 million in 2002. During 2004, we invested in additional capacity for our European operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and to provide a platform to introduce new proprietary film products. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be in the $185 million to $200 million range. Increased expenditures for 2005 primarily relate to capacity needs in North American operations. After 2005, capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14.3 percent during the first quarter of 2004 to 16 cents per share from 14 cents per share. This follows increases of 7.7 percent in 2003 and 4.0 percent in 2002. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved the 22nd consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 18 cents per share, a 12.5 percent increase. Share Repurchases We did not make any share repurchases during the three years presented. As of December 31, 2004, management is authorized to purchase up to 4.7 million shares of common stock for the treasury. 12 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2004. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt payments (1) $ 572.0 $ 115.7 $ 25.4 $ 422.4 $ 8.5 Capital leases (2) 0.7 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.0 Operating leases (3) 26.0 6.8 7.4 4.4 7.4 Purchase obligations (4) 136.5 132.7 3.7 0.1 0.0 Pension contributions (5) 5.2 5.2 (1) Amount noted includes estimated interest costs. Long term and short term debt obligations, excluding interest, are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on September 2, 2009. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our debt and related matters. (2) Amount noted includes estimated interest costs. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations. (3) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (5) Amount noted is funding requirements of non U.S. pension plans. No requirements exist for future funding. Interest Rate Swaps Our long term unsecured notes include $100 million due in July 2005 and $250 million due in August 2008. In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expire in 2005 and 2008, reduced the interest cost of the $350 million of long term debt from about 6.6 percent to about 3.2 percent in 2004. Since these variable rates are based upon six month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $518.4 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $5.2 million. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the fair value of these swaps, which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $14.9 million at December 31, 2004, and an asset of $22.6 million at December 31, 2003. For each period, an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding. These fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public bonds, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. Interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $518.4 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $5.2 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, principally for transactions in non Euro zone countries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months and relate primarily to major Western European currencies. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and 13 recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on 2004 net sales was an increase of $59.6 million or 2.3 percent from 2003. Operating profit improved by approximately $4.8 million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during 2004. Long term Compensation While our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period, we have also granted some stock options in the past. Beginning in 2004, we discontinued the awarding of stock options. Stock options granted prior to 2004 were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Stock options for Directors vested immediately, while options for Company employees become vested over three years (one third per year). Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Options, we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding, as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method, in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements. Beginning July 1, 2005, accounting rules will require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options. If we followed this fair value method during 2004, diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by one cent for the year ended 2004, two cents for the year ended 2003, and one cent for the year ended 2002. We expect the impact to diluted earnings per share for 2005 to be insignificant. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for annual pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. As permitted by SFAS No. 87, we use a calculated value of plan assets (which is further described below). SFAS No. 87 requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods. Pension expense recorded in 2004 was $25.2 million, compared to pension expense of $9.6 million in 2003 and pension income of $3.2 million in 2002. We expect 2005 pension expense to be comparable to the levels of 2004. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets. As of January 1, 2005, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75 percent. This represents a decrease from the 9.0 percent level assumed for 2004 and 9.5 percent level assumed for 2003. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long term investment periods of 10, 15 and 20 years, our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of 10.9 percent, 10.1 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively, each in excess of our assumed rates. In future years, we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment. Considering this, we selected an 8.75 percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of January 1, 2005. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 80 percent equity securities and 20 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. 14 At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2004, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.75 percent, a decrease of one half of one percent from the 6.25 percent rate used at December 31, 2003. Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.75 percent for the discount rate and 8.75 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2005 to be in a range of $25 million to $28 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2005 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense to pension expense ($ in millions) from current assumptions from current assumptions Discount rate Rate of Return on Plan Assets 5.00 percent $ 6.0 8.00 percent $ 2.9 5.25 percent 4.0 8.25 percent 1.9 5.50 percent 2.0 8.50 percent 1.0 5.75 percentCurrent Assumption 0.0 8.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (1.9 ) 9.00 percent (1.0 ) 6.25 percent (3.8 ) 9.25 percent (1.9 ) 6.50 percent (5.7 ) 9.50 percent (2.9 ) The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment on equity, net of tax, resulting from changes in the assumed discount rate. Total (increase) decrease in equity from current assumptions Discount rate 5.00 percent $ 55.2 5.25 percent (1) 46.9 5.50 percent 2.7 5.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (2.6 ) 6.25 percent (5.2 ) 6.50 percent (7.6 ) (1) If the discount rate had been reduced to 5.25 percent at December 31, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension plans would have exceeded the related plan assets. This would then have required a minimum pension liability adjustment with a corresponding reduction to equity, net of tax, of about $46.9 million. A further decrease in the discount rate to 5.00 percent would only result in an additional equity adjustment of $8.3 million. Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $442.2 million as of December 31, 2004. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 20 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options. FAS 123R requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to 15 provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. A public entity will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on its current fair value; the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. The Company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the Companys results of operation. On November 24, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard adopts the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Board made the decision to clarify the meaning of the term normal capacity. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has not determined the impact of this SFAS No. 151 to its inventory accounting results which may result upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) No. FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP provides guidance on how an enterprise should account for the deduction for qualified production activities provided by the American Jobs Act of 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new deduction, the benefit of which will be considered in our future tax provisions. In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a companys accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings. The new law provides for a special one time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated and which meet certain requirements. We are currently evaluating whether any of the earnings of our non U.S. operations will be repatriated in accordance with the terms of this law. Subsequent Events On January 5, 2005, Bemis announced that it had acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America and Bemis Brazil based partner in the Itap Bemis Ltda. joint venture. In this transaction, we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of Dixie Toga for a total cash price of approximately $250 million. The purchase price was initially financed with commercial paper and, combined with a small amount of debt assumed in the acquisition, our debt to total capitalization ratio increased on the acquisition date to approximately 36 percent. Preferred stock of Dixie Toga is publicly traded on the Brazilian Bovespa Stock Exchange. Dixie Toga recorded annual revenues during 2004 in excess of $300 million. With this acquisition, the results of operations of Dixie Toga will include our Brazilian joint venture, Itap Bemis Ltda., and will be consolidated in our financial statements beginning in January of 2005. We expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on our financial results in 2005. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; operating results and cash flows from acquisitions may differ from what we anticipate; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs, availability, and terms, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings, including the U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry, any related proceedings or civil lawsuits, and the investigation by European Anticompetitive Authorities into the competitive practices in the Paper and Forestry Products industries; unexpected outcomes in our current and future tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. 16 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Form 10 K Annual Report. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
