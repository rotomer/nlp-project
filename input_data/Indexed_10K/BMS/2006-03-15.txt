Generally about 60 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn and garden. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 82 percent of our net sales. The remaining 18 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. In recent years we have actively expanded our global reach with acquisitions and capital additions, growing net sales in non U.S. markets from 23 percent in 2003 to 34 percent in 2005. Market Conditions During 2004 and 2005, higher petrochemical feedstock costs significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives, the primary raw materials for our business segments. Our business model has been developed to accommodate such cost increases by periodically adjusting selling prices to reflect increased costs. As raw material prices increase, the time lag between cost increases and selling price increases results in reduced operating margins. During the first half of 2005, this negative impact on operating profit was magnified by production volume fluctuations due to a shift in customer order patterns and a highly competitive environment. During the second half of 2005, the plastics industry was challenged to find alternative sources of raw materials as the petrochemical industry suffered facility damage, production disruptions and transportation shortages due to the impact of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Bemis successfully managed raw material supplies in this challenging environment and remained a reliable supplier to our customers. Restructuring and Related Charges During the third quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program in which three flexible packaging plants were closed. This program eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer, more efficient facilities. While most of the restructuring activities were completed as of December 31, 2003 resulting in a net charge of $13.9 million for 2003, gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net gain of $0.7 million during 2004 and a loss of $0.6 million during 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program for our pressure sensitive materials business segment to reduce capacity and fixed costs associated with our label materials product line. The majority of the restructuring activities were completed by the second quarter of 2004. Restructuring charges totaled $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, $3.1 million in 2004 and a net gain of $1.5 million in 2005. On January 25, 2006, we announced a $40 million facility consolidation project intended to reduce fixed costs and shift production to lower cost facilities. Of this total charge, approximately $25 million is expected to be expensed during the first half of 2006. These restructuring costs include the estimated cost of plant shutdowns, corporate headquarters relocation, employee severance, equipment relocation and other exit activities. We estimate the savings resulting from the restructuring events to be approximately $17 million annually, a portion of which will be realized in the second half of 2006. Acquisitions Our acquisitions strategy is growth oriented, focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies, access to new markets or product lines, or critical mass. Since the beginning of 2003, we have completed three acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments. These three acquisitions have added approximately $500 million of net sales, all of which is from non U.S. manufacturing plants. These plants are focused on serving the needs of the geographic regions in which they reside. On January 5, 2005, we acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America with 2004 annual revenues totaling about $325 million. The acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of Dixie Toga in addition to 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock. The initial cash purchase price was approximately $250 million. This acquisition significantly increases our exposure to the growing South American packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region. Since 1998, Bemis and Dixie Toga have operated a joint venture in Brazil, known as Itap Bemis Ltda., and have established a successful working relationship. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 3,474.0 $ 2,834.4 $ 2,635.0 Operating profit 374.0 342.2 280.1 Net income 162.5 180.0 147.1 Diluted earnings per share 1.51 1.67 1.37 2005 versus 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales increased 22.6 percent. Acquisitions accounted for 16.5 percent of the increase in sales while currency translation was insignificant to net sales growth in 2005. The remaining 6.1 percent increase in net sales reflects the impact of increased prices and a shift in product mix in all market categories. Price increases during 2005 were driven by increased raw material costs. Unit volume was flat compared to 2004. 11 Operating profit increased 9.3 percent in 2005 reflecting the profits contributed by the Dixie Toga acquisition. Operating profit in 2004 includes a $5.6 million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant. In addition, restructuring and related activities included in operating profit accounted for a $0.9 million gain in 2005 and a $2.4 million expense in 2004. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring and related activities, operating profit would have been $372.6 million in 2005 compared to $339.0 million in 2004. Operating profit in 2005 was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and a related shift in customer order patterns in the first half of the year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.51 for 2005, which included a $0.056 per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. For 2004, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.67, which included restructuring and related charges of about $0.014 per share and a gain of $0.032 per share on the sale of certain plant assets. 2004 versus 2003 Net sales in 2004 increased 7.6 percent from net sales of $2.64 billion in 2003. Acquisitions accounted for 1.1 percent of the net sales growth, while currency translation accounted for about 2.3 percent. The remaining 4.2 percent sales growth primarily reflects the solid increase in flexible packaging sales volumes during 2004. Operating profit increased 22.2 percent in 2004. Operating profit in 2004 includes a $5.6 million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant. In addition, restructuring and related activities included in operating profit accounted for a $2.4 million expense in 2004 and a $16.7 million expense in 2003. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring and related activities, operating profit would have been $339.0 million in 2004 compared to $296.7 million in 2003. Cost savings in 2004 resulting from the completed restructuring programs were partially offset by increased pension expense. Sales mix improvements resulted in increased operating profit during 2004. During 2003, competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive label materials, in addition to increases in certain resin costs, contributed to lower margins. For 2004, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.67, including restructuring and related charges of about $0.014 per share and a gain of $0.032 per share on the sale of certain plant assets. Diluted earnings per share for 2003 totaled $1.37, including $0.095 of restructuring and related charges. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, medical devices, bakery and dry foods. These markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. During periods of unusual raw material cost volatility, selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs. Resin costs increased dramatically in 2004 and 2005. These raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices throughout each year, however the magnitude and frequency of the cost increases negatively impacted operating profit. In July 2003, we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs, take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities. We closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of 2003, recording restructuring and related charges of $13.9 million during 2003. The net restructuring gain of $0.7 million in 2004 and the net restructuring charge of $0.6 million in 2005, both classified as other costs (income), net, relate primarily to the sale of closed facilities. (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 2,855.8 $ 2,249.6 $ 2,100.9 Operating profit 332.7 308.3 263.8 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 11.7 % 13.7 % 12.6 % 2005 versus 2004 Our flexible packaging business segment recorded a 27.0 percent increase in net sales in 2005. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by 20.8 percent. The remaining 6.2 percent increase is attributable to price and mix across all market categories. Unit sales volume was even with 2004 as increases in demand for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese, health and hygiene, cereal and other dry foods, coffee, unitizing films for cans and bottles, and medical devices were offset by lower unit sales for markets such as confectionery and snack, frozen foods, bakery and pet products. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a gain of $5.6 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Florence, Kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring and related activities, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 11.7 percent in 2005 and 13.4 percent in 2004. Savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation costs in 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Net sales increased 7.1 percent in 2004, primarily driven by increased unit sales volume. Strong unit sales in markets for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack foods, frozen foods, personal care products, cereal products and unitizing film for cans and bottles were partially offset by lower unit sales to bakery, pet product and industrial markets. Price increases and a shift in product mix 12 increased sales by about 1.1 percent in 2004, as customers balanced price increases with changes in product mix. Acquisitions accounted for an increase of 0.8 percent and currency translation accounted for 1.8 percent of the improvement from 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a gain of $5.6 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Florence, Kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring and related activities, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 13.4 percent in 2004 compared to 13.2 percent in 2003. Savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation costs in 2004. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, battery, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. During 2004, the increased cost of petrochemical products caused an associated increase in the cost of adhesive materials in addition to a concern about availability of adhesive from suppliers. In response to these cost increases, we increased selling prices and secured alternative supplies of raw materials in case of shortages. We focused on margin expansion by introducing new product innovations and quality initiatives during the year. In addition, recent restructuring activities resulted in better capacity utilization in label products. In October of 2003, we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity. We closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization in our label products line. Restructuring and related charges of $2.7 million were recorded in 2003, of which $2.3 million represented severance and other similar charges and was recorded as other costs (income), net. The remaining $0.4 million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and related charges and was recorded as an element of costs of products sold. During 2004, restructuring and related charges totaling $3.1 million primarily reflected the cost of closing a label products plant in Nevada. Of this total, $1.8 million represented equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs (income), net, with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold. During 2005, a net gain of $1.5 million was recorded for the sale of previously closed facilities and property. During 2005, we changed the year end for several of our pressure sensitive materials European subsidiaries from November 30 to December 31. This resulted in a 13 month reporting period in 2005 for this subsidiary, increasing net sales by $17.2 million, but the impact on operating profit was minimal. (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 618.2 $ 584.8 $ 534.2 Operating profit 41.3 33.9 16.3 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 6.7 % 5.8 % 3.1 % 2005 versus 2004 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of 5.7 percent in 2005. Excluding the impact of the thirteenth month of net sales from the European subsidiary, net sales would have increased 2.7 percent. This increase was driven by unit sales volume growth in label products during the year, partially offset by unit sales volume decreases in the other pressure sensitive product categories. Price increases were offset by a negative sales mix change in 2005, and currency had no impact on net sales for the year. Operating profit increased in 2005. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities, operating profit would have been $39.3 million, or 6.4 percent of net sales in 2005 compared to $37.0 million, or 6.3 percent of net sales in 2004. Currency translation did not impact operating profit in 2005. Improved profit levels in 2005 reflect improved sales mix and focused cost control measures. 2004 versus 2003 A November 2003 acquisition of a European graphic products business increased net sales in 2004 by 2.6 percent and currency translation provided a 4.2 percent increase. About 44 percent of the sales from this business segment are from our manufacturing operations in Belgium, which benefited from the strengthening of the European currencies during 2004. Stronger unit sales of technical products more than offset slightly lower unit sales of label and graphic products compared to 2003. Price and mix provided a combined improvement to net sales during the year of about 1.0 percent. Operating profit more than doubled in 2004 compared to 2003. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities, operating profit would have been $37.0 million or 6.3 percent of net sales in 2004 compared to $19.0 million or 3.6 percent of net sales in 2003. Currency translation contributed $2.2 million to operating profit in 2004. Improved profit levels in 2004 reflect improved sales mix, focused cost control measures, and the savings associated with restructuring activities, partially offset by increased pension expense. Consolidated Gross Margin (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross margin $ 675.6 $ 595.7 $ 533.5 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales 19.4 % 21.0 % 20.2 % 13 Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $1.1 million in 2004 and $7.6 million in 2003. The time lag between the implementation of selling price increases and dramatic increases in raw material costs reduced gross margins as a percentage of net sales in each of the years presented. This reduction in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by ongoing improvements in production efficiency, sales mix and cost management during the same timeframe. Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 330.9 $ 285.0 $ 256.7 SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales 9.5 % 10.1 % 9.7 % In 2005, the lower ratio of expenses to net sales reflects lower costs associated with the South American operations and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales. An increased ratio of expenses as a percent of net sales for 2004 reflects the larger sales organization associated with our global sales efforts and an increase from 2003 in broad based incentive compensation and pension expense. Other Expenses (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Research and development expenses (R&D) $ 23.5 $ 21.1 $ 21.5 R&D expense as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.8 % Interest expense 38.7 15.5 12.6 Other costs (income), net 0.1 (20.1 ) 2.7 Minority interest 5.9 0.5 0.9 Income taxes 113.9 113.7 92.1 Effective tax rate 41.2 % 38.7 % 38.5 % Research and Development Expenses Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense The increase in interest expense in 2005 reflects higher debt levels as a result of the January 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga and higher interest rates in 2005 compared to 2004 and 2003. Prior to 2005, substantially all of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates which averaged 1.4 percent in 2004 and 1.3 percent in 2003. In 2005, we issued $300 million of fixed rate public bonds at a 4.875 percent interest rate. This effectively reduced our percentage of variable rate debt to about 62 percent of total debt in 2005 as variable rates climbed to an average of 3.3 percent during 2005. Other Costs (Income), Net In 2005, net other expenses primarily reflect interest income offset by currency exchange losses. Net other income in 2004 includes a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility during the fourth quarter partially offset by restructuring and related charges of $1.2 million. Equity income from our Brazilian joint venture was $11.7 million in 2004, reflecting improved profitability in addition to an increase in our equity ownership from 33 percent to 45 percent in January 2004. The remainder of other income in 2004 is primarily interest income. During 2003, net other costs included $8.9 million of restructuring and related charges associated with employee severance and the closure of manufacturing facilities. The Brazilian joint venture accounted for $3.2 million of equity income during 2003. Since the January 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga, the Brazilian joint venture is accounted for on a consolidated basis and the related operating results are included with the flexible packaging segment. Minority Interest In connection with the January 5, 2005 acquisition, we acquired approximately 80 percent of the total outstanding shares of Dixie Toga. As of December 31, 2005, our ownership had increased to approximately 86 percent of the total outstanding shares. The increase in minority interest in 2005 is primarily due to the shares of Dixie Toga that were not acquired. Income Taxes During 2005, an additional $6.0 million of tax expense was recorded as a result of the repatriation of non U.S. subsidiary earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding the effect of this additional tax, the effective tax rate for 2005 was 39.0 percent. Our effective tax rate was 38.7 percent in 2004 and 38.5 percent in 2003. The difference between our overall tax rate and the U. S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned the Company long term credit ratings of A from Standard & Poors and Baa1 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A 1 and Prime 2 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service, respectively. Our strong financial positions and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. 14 Sources of Liquidity Cash provided by operations was $280.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $271.5 million in 2004 and $311.1 million in 2003. Cash provided by operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $35 million, $50 million and $40 million, respectively. While no contributions are required for 2006, we continue to monitor the funded status of our U.S. pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity. Increasing raw material costs during the three year period resulted in increased levels of working capital, which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during 2004 and 2005. In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our liquidity needs. At year end 2005, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $112.0 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we have ready access to the commercial paper markets. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility. In September 2004, we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to September 2009. This credit facility provides $500 million of available financing supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. In addition to funds available under this credit facility, we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. If these credit facilities and ECNs were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up credit agreement expires in 2009. The $500 million credit facility includes a $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2005, outstanding multicurrency borrowings under the credit facility totaled $82.4 million which were used to fund the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings to the U.S. based parent company. Borrowings from the credit agreement mature in September 2009 and charge a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2005, available capacity on the credit agreement which matures in September 2009 was $297.7 million. Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $187.0 million during 2005, compared to $134.5 million in 2004 and $106.5 million in 2003. During 2005, we invested in additional capacity for our South American operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and we invested in new capacity in our high growth North American production plants. Capital expenditures for 2006 are estimated to be in the $175 million to $185 million range. After 2006, capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 12.5 percent during the first quarter of 2005 to 18 cents per share from 16 cents per share. This follows increases of 14.3 percent in 2004 and 7.7 percent in 2003. In February 2006, the Board of Directors approved the 23rd consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 19 cents per share, a 5.6 percent increase. Share Repurchases During 2005, we purchased 1.9 million shares of common stock in the open market. We also established a program to purchase shares annually to offset the dilutive effect of stock award programs. We did not make any share repurchases during 2004 or 2003. As of December 31, 2005, we are authorized to purchase up to 2.8 million shares of common stock for the treasury. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2005.

The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations. (4) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (5) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. Interest Rate Swaps Our long term unsecured notes include $250 million due in August 2008. In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expire in 2008, reduced the interest cost of the $250 million of long term debt from 6.5 percent to about 5.5 percent in 2005. Since these variable rates are based upon six month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the fair value of these swaps, which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $5.0 million at December 31, 2005, and an asset of $14.9 million at December 31, 2004. For each period, an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding. These fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public bonds, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. Interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $844.1 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $5.2 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $4.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on 2005 net sales was an increase of $5.4 million from net sales levels in 2004. Operating profit improved by approximately $0.6 million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during 2005. Long term Compensation Our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period. The 1994 and 2001 Stock Incentive Plans for certain key employees provide for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 grants, respectively. Total compensation expense related to these plans was $16,464,000 in 2005, $13,776,000 in 2004, and $10,666,000 in 2003. In addition, we have granted stock options in the past. Beginning in 2004, we discontinued the awarding of stock options. Stock options granted prior to 2004 were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding, as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method, in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements. Beginning January 1, 2006, accounting rules require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options. If we had followed this fair value method during 2005, the impact on diluted earnings per share would have been insignificant for the year ended 2005, one cent for the year ended 2004, and two cents for the year ended 2003. We expect the impact to diluted earnings per share for 2006 to be insignificant. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation 16 of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for annual pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with FAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. As permitted by FAS No. 87, we use a calculated value of plan assets (which is further described below). FAS No. 87 requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods. Pension expense recorded in 2005 was $30.3 million, compared to pension expense of $25.2 million in 2004 and $9.6 million in 2003. Effective January 1, 2006, our largest U.S. defined benefit pension plan has been amended to substantially reduce future pension benefits affecting approximately two thirds of the plan participants. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits will be replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. As a result, we expect 2006 pension expense to be to be lower than 2005. Depending upon our financial performance in 2006, this reduction in pension expense is expected to be substantially offset by expenses under the new defined contribution plan. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with FAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets. As of January 1, 2006, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75 percent. This is consistent with the rate assumed for 2005 and a decrease from the 9.0 percent level assumed for 2004. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long term investment periods of 10, 15 and 20 years, our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of 9.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively, each in excess of our assumed rates. In future years, we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment. Considering this, we selected an 8.75 percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of January 1, 2006. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 80 percent equity securities and 20 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2005, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.50 percent, a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the 5.75 percent rate used at December 31, 2004. Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2006 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. (dollars in millions) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense from current assumptions Discount rate 4.75 percent $ 5.1 5.00 percent 3.4 5.25 percent 1.7 5.50 percent Current Assumption 0.0 5.75 percent (1.7 ) 6.00 percent (3.3 ) 6.25 percent (5.1 ) Rate of Return on Plan Assets 8.00 percent $ 3.3 8.25 percent 2.2 8.50 percent 1.1 8.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 9.00 percent (1.1 ) 9.25 percent (2.2 ) 9.50 percent (3.3 ) 17 The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment to equity to changes in the assumed discount rate. (dollars in millions) Total increase (decrease) in minimum pension liability, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 4.75 percent $ 67.5 5.00 percent (1) 58.1 5.25 percent 3.2 5.50 percent Current Assumption 0.0 5.75 percent (3.1 ) 6.00 percent (6.0 ) 6.25 percent (8.9 ) (1) If the discount rate had been reduced to 5.00 percent at December 31, 2005, the accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension plans would exceed the related plan assets. This would have required a minimum pension liability adjustment with a corresponding reduction to equity, net of tax, of about $58.1 million. A further decrease in discount rate to 4.75 percent would only result in an additional equity adjustment of $9.4 million. Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $581.4 million as of December 31, 2005. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, operating condition and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed the mandated adoption date for public companies with a December 31 year end until January 1, 2006. FAS 123R requires that the Company measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the Companys results of operation. On November 24, 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard adopts the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Board made the decision to clarify the meaning of the term normal capacity. The provisions of FAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has not determined the impact of this FAS No. 151 to its inventory accounting results which may result upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 2006. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements 18 expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; operating results and cash flows from acquisitions may differ from what we anticipate; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs, availability, and terms, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings, including the U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry, any related proceedings or civil lawsuits, and the investigation by European Anticompetitive Authorities into the competitive practices in the Paper and Forestry Products industries; unexpected outcomes in our current and future tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
