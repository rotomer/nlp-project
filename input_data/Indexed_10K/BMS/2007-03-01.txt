ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis Three Years Ended December 31, 2006 Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Three year review of results (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 3,639.4 100.0 % $ 3,474.0 100.0 % $ 2,834.4 100.0 % Cost of products sold 2,942.7 80.9 2,798.3 80.6 2,238.7 79.0 Gross margin 696.7 19.1 675.7 19.4 595.7 21.0 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 336.4 9.2 330.9 9.5 285.0 10.1 All other expenses 74.5 2.0 68.4 1.9 17.0 0.6 Income before income taxes 285.8 7.9 276.4 8.0 293.7 10.3 Provision for income taxes 109.5 3.1 113.9 3.3 113.7 4.0 Net income $ 176.3 4.8 % $ 162.5 4.7 % 180.0 6.3 % Effective income tax rate 38.3 % 41.2 % 38.7 % 9 Overview Bemis Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Generally about 60 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn and garden. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 82 percent of our net sales. The remaining 18 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. Market Conditions The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our leading flexible packaging market positions in North and South America reflect our focus on value added, proprietary products that are not available from most of our competitors. During 2006, many of our large customers announced sales growth strategies that were supported by new product introductions. This provides opportunities for future growth at Bemis since new customer products often require innovative new packaging. In Europe and Asia, where our market position is smaller, we continue to introduce our proprietary products to the market, and we are encouraged by the strengthening economies in those regions. The stronger European economy has also benefited our pressure sensitive graphic product line which is predominately sold in Europe. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins and adhesives. The cost of raw materials moderated during 2006 after experiencing a period of significant volatility during late 2004 and 2005. Raw material costs have been impacted in recent years by higher energy prices in addition to production disruptions related to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Restructuring and Related Charges On January 25, 2006, we announced a facility consolidation project intended to reduce fixed costs and shift production to lower cost facilities. These cost reduction efforts included the closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility during 2006 and was substantially complete as of December 31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges incurred in 2006 totaled $31.2 million, of which $12.3 million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold. The remaining $18.9 million primarily reflects employee related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs (income). During 2003, we initiated a restructuring program in which five facilities were closed. While most of the restructuring activities were completed as of December 31, 2003, gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net charge of $2.4 million in 2004 and a net gain of $0.9 million in 2005. Acquisitions On January 5, 2005, we acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America with 2004 annual revenues totaling about $325 million. The acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of Dixie Toga in addition to 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock. The initial cash purchase price, paid in 2005, was approximately $235 million increased by $4.2 million in 2006 related to post close adjustments. This acquisition significantly increased our exposure to the growing South American packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region. Subsequently, our South American subsidiary has repurchased additional shares of its outstanding preferred stock in the open market, reducing the total minority interest in our subsidiary to 14 percent as of December 31, 2006. In April 2006, we also acquired the remaining shares of our three majority owned joint ventures in Mexico for $6.8 million. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 3,639.4 $ 3,474.0 $ 2,834.4 Net income 176.3 162.5 180.0 Diluted earnings per share 1.65 1.51 1.67 2006 versus 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, net sales increased 4.8 percent. Currency translation was a benefit to net sales growth of 1.8 percent. The remaining 3.0 percent increase in net sales reflects increased sales of higher priced, value added products in each of the two business segments. Diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for 2006, including $0.18 per share of restructuring and related charges. For 2005, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.51, including approximately $0.06 per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The improvement in 2006 resulted from a more profitable sales mix, a moderating raw material cost environment, and successful cost management efforts. 2005 versus 2004 For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales increased 22.6 percent. The 2005 Dixie Toga acquisition accounted for 16.5 percent of the increase in sales while currency translation was insignificant to net sales growth in 2005. The remaining 6.1 percent increase in net sales reflects the impact of increased price and mix in all market categories. Price increases during 2005 were driven by increased raw material costs. Unit volume was flat compared to 2004. 10 Diluted earnings per share were $1.51 for 2005, including $0.06 per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. For 2004, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.67, including a net gain of $0.02 per share on the sale of certain plant assets. Results for 2005 were negatively impacted by significant increases in raw material costs during the year. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, medical devices, bakery, and dry foods. These markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. During periods of unusual raw material cost volatility, selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs. During both 2004 and 2005, resin costs dramatically increased resulting in double digit percentage increases for each year. These raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices throughout each year; however the magnitude and frequency of the cost increases negatively impacted operating profit. The impact of raw material cost changes in 2006 was more moderate. In January of 2006, we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment. These efforts were substantially completed by December 31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled $29.0 million in 2006. The disposal of facilities closed during the 2003 restructuring program resulted in a charge of $0.6 million in 2005 and a gain of $0.7 million in 2004. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 3,000.1 $ 2,855.8 $ 2,249.6 Operating profit (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 335.1 332.7 308.3 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 11.2 % 11.7 % 13.7 % 2006 versus 2005 Our flexible packaging business segment recorded a 5.1 percent increase in net sales in 2006. Currency translation was a benefit of 2.1 percent. The remaining 3.0 percent increase is attributable to increased net sales for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese, health and hygiene, coffee, unitizing films for cans and bottles, and medical devices. This was partially offset by lower net sales for markets such as confectionery, snack and frozen foods. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.2 percent in 2006 from 11.7 percent in 2005. During 2006, restructuring and related charges totaling $29.0 million were recorded as a reduction of operating profit. Operating profit in 2006 benefited from stronger sales of value added flexible packaging products. During 2005, operating profit includes the impact of restructuring and related charges totaling $0.6 million. 2005 versus 2004 Our flexible packaging business segment recorded a 27.0 percent increase in net sales in 2005. The acquisition of Dixie Toga increased 2005 sales by 20.8 percent. The remaining 6.2 percent increase is attributable to price and mix across all market categories. Increases in demand for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese, health and hygiene, cereal and other dry foods, coffee, unitizing films for cans and bottles, and medical devices were offset by lower unit sales for markets such as confectionery and snack, frozen foods, bakery, and pet products. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a gain of $5.6 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Florence, Kentucky. During 2005, raw material cost increases outpaced increases in selling prices, negatively impacting operating profit. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. In January of 2006, we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. This effort was completed by December 31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges incurred and related to the pressure sensitive materials business segment totaled $1.0 million in 2006. These costs were primarily employee related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs (income), net. 11 In 2003, we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity, closing two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization. During 2004, restructuring and related charges totaling $3.1 million related primarily to the cost of closing a label products plant in Nevada. Of this total, $1.8 million represented equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs (income), net, with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold. During 2005, a net gain of $1.5 million was recorded for the sale of previously closed facilities and property. During 2005, we changed the year end of our pressure sensitive materials European subsidiary from November 30 to December 31. This resulted in a 13 month reporting period in 2005 for this subsidiary, increasing 2005 net sales by $17.2 million. The impact on operating profit was insignificant. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 639.3 $ 618.1 $ 584.8 Operating profit (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 50.1 41.3 33.9 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 7.8 % 6.7 % 5.8 % 2006 versus 2005 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of 3.4 percent in 2006. Net sales in 2005 include the impact of the thirteenth month of net sales from the European subsidiary. The increase in net sales in 2006 was driven by unit sales volume growth in each of the pressure sensitive materials product lines during the year. Currency benefits provided less than one percent net sales growth in 2006. Operating profit as a percent of sales improved in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting increased sales of value added graphic and technical products. In addition, the profitability of the label product line increased with continued improvements in cost management and production efficiency. Currency translation did not impact operating profit in 2006. 2005 versus 2004 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of 5.7 percent in 2005. The thirteenth month of net sales from the European subsidiary accounted for about 3.0 percent sales growth compared to 2004. The remaining 2.7 percent increase was driven by unit sales volume growth in label products during the year, partially offset by unit sales volume decreases in the other product categories. Price increases were offset by increased unit sales of lower priced label products in 2005, and currency had no impact on net sales for the year. Improved profit levels in 2005 reflect improved profit from label products and focused cost control measures. Currency translation did not impact operating profit in 2005 and contributed $2.2 million in 2004. Consolidated Gross Margin (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Gross margin $ 696.7 $ 675.6 $ 595.7 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales 19.1 % 19.4 % 21.0 % Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $12.9 million in 2006 and $1.1 million in 2004. The time lag between the implementation of selling price increases and increases in raw material costs reduced gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented. This reduction in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by ongoing improvements in production efficiency, sales mix and cost management during the same timeframe. Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 336.4 $ 330.9 $ 285.0 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 9.2 % 9.5 % 10.1 % In 2006, the lower ratio of expenses to net sales reflects the benefits of cost management programs, and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales. In 2005, the lower ratio compared to 2004 reflects lower costs associated with the South American operations purchased in January 2005, and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales. Other Expenses (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Research and development (R&D) $ 25.0 $ 23.5 $ 21.1 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense $ 49.3 $ 38.7 $ 15.5 Other costs (income), net (3.3 ) 0.1 (20.1 ) Minority interest in net income 3.5 5.9 0.5 Income taxes 109.5 113.9 113.7 Effective tax rate 38.3 % 41.2 % 38.7 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use 12 of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness and relevance of our research and developments activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense The increase in interest expense in 2006 reflects higher interest rates in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004. In addition, debt levels increased in 2005 as a result of the January 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga. Prior to 2005, substantially all of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates. In 2005, we issued $300 million of fixed rate public bonds at a 4.875 percent interest rate. This effectively reduced our percentage of variable rate debt to about 59 percent in 2006 and 62 percent in 2005. The effective interest rate was 5.9 percent in 2006, 4.9 percent in 2005, and 2.7 percent in 2004. Other Costs (Income), Net In 2006, other costs (income) included $18.3 million of restructuring and related charges, which were more than offset by financial income of $18.0 million and a $4.5 million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability. About half of the financial income relates to interest income on cash held at non U.S. locations. The remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. In 2005, net other expenses primarily reflect interest income offset by currency exchange losses. Net other income in 2004 includes a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility partially offset by restructuring and related charges of $1.2 million. Equity income from our Brazilian joint venture was $11.7 million in 2004. Since the January 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga, the Brazilian joint venture has been accounted for on a consolidated basis and the related operating results are included with the flexible packaging segment. The remainder of other income in 2004 is primarily interest income. Minority Interest in Net Income In connection with the January 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga, we acquired approximately 80 percent of the total outstanding shares of Dixie Toga. As of December 31, 2006, our ownership had increased to approximately 86 percent of the total outstanding shares. The increase in minority interest in net income in 2005 is primarily due to the accounting for the shares of Dixie Toga that were not acquired. In April 2006, we acquired the remaining minority interest in our three Mexican joint ventures which reduced minority interest in net income. Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate and the U. S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. During 2005, an additional $6.0 million of tax expense was recorded as a result of the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (The Jobs Act), increasing the effective tax rate for 2005 from 39.0 percent to 41.2 percent. For the total year 2006, the effective tax rate was 38.3 percent, reflecting the final determination of the benefits provided under The Jobs Act. Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt to Total Capitalization Debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt, long term deferred tax liabilities and equity) was 33.0 percent at December 31, 2006, compared to 35.7 percent at December 31, 2005 and 26.7 percent at December 31, 2004. Total debt was $789.8 million, $844.1 million, and $539.6 million at year end 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 primarily reflects the impact of the Dixie Toga acquisition in January 2005. Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned Bemis Company long term credit ratings of A from Standard & Poors and Baa1 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A 1 and Prime 2 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. Our strong financial positions and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. Sources of Liquidity Cash provided by operations was $349.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $280.4 million in 2005 and $271.5 million in 2004. Cash provided by operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $24.0 million, $35.0 million, and $50.0 million, respectively. While no contributions are required for our U.S. pension plans in 2007, we continue to monitor the funded status of all pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity. Increasing raw material costs during the three year period resulted in increased levels of working capital, which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during each of the three years presented. In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $80.7 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility. In September 2004, we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to September 2009. This credit facility provides $500 million of available financing supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. In addition to funds available under this credit facility, we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. If these credit facilities and ECNs were no 13 longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. The $500 million credit facility includes a $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, outstanding multicurrency borrowings under the credit facility totaled $59.7 million. Borrowings from the credit agreement mature in September 2009 and are subject to a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2006, available capacity on the credit agreement which matures in September 2009 was $351.6 million. Long term Debt Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2006, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up credit agreement expires in 2009. Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $158.8 million during 2006, compared to $187.0 million in 2005, and $134.5 million in 2004. Higher levels of expenditures in 2005 funded additional capacity for our South American operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and new capacity in our high growth North American production plants. Capital expenditures for 2007 are estimated to be in the $175 million to $185 million range, which includes about $20 million of costs related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system. After 2007, capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5.6 percent during the first quarter of 2006 to 19 cents per share from 18 cents per share. This follows increases of 12.5 percent in 2005 and 14.3 percent in 2004. In February 2007, the Board of Directors approved the 24th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 21 cents per share, a 10.5 percent increase. Share Repurchases During 2006, we purchased 600,000 shares of common stock in the open market. During 2005, we purchased 1.9 million shares of common stock in the open market. We did not make any share repurchases during 2004. As of December 31, 2006, we were authorized to purchase up to 2.2 million shares of additional common stock for the treasury. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 3 million shares for repurchase. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2006. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt payments (1) $ 787.1 $ 67.4 $ 396.9 $ 1.0 $ 321.8 Interest expense (2) 143.0 44.7 56.8 33.9 7.6 Capital leases (3) 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 0.0 Operating leases (4) 17.8 4.3 5.2 3.2 5.1 Purchase obligations (5) 162.4 162.3 0.1 0.0 0.0 Postretirement obligations (6) 53.1 2.9 7.5 14.6 28.1 (1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on September 2, 2009. (2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December 31, 2006. (3) Amount noted also includes estimated interest costs. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations. (4) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (5) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (6) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. 14 Interest Rate Swaps Our long term unsecured notes include $250 million due in August 2008. In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expire in 2008, reduced the interest cost of the $250 million of long term debt from 6.5 percent to about 6.0 percent in 2006. Since these variable rates are based upon six month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the fair value of these swaps, which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $2.5 million at December 31, 2006, and an asset of $5.0 million at December 31, 2005. For each period, an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding. These fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. In connection with the issue of seven year, $300 million notes in March 2005, we entered into a forward starting swap on February 3, 2005, in order to lock in an interest rate in advance of the pricing date for the notes. On March 14, 2005, in connection with the pricing of the notes, we terminated the swap and recorded the resulting gain of $6.1 million (pre tax) on the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income. This gain is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public bonds, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. Interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $789.8 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $4.7 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $63.3 million in 2006 and $5.4 million in 2005. Operating profit improved by approximately $7.0 million in 2006 and $0.6 million in 2005 as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation. Long term Compensation Our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock unit programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period. Beginning in 2004, we discontinued the awarding of stock options. Stock options granted prior to 2004 were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Stock options for Directors vested immediately, while options for Company employees generally become vested over three years (one third per year). Beginning January 1, 2006, accounting rules require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options. The impact to diluted earnings per share for stock options expense in 2006 was insignificant. If we had followed this fair value method prior to 2006, the impact on diluted earnings per share would have been one cent for each year ended 2005 and 2004. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 15 We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for annual pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with FAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended by FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. FAS No. 158 requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Pension expense recorded in 2006 was $16.1 million, compared to pension expense of $27.7 million in 2005 and $22.6 million in 2004. Effective January 1, 2006, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two thirds of the participant population. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets. As of January 1, 2007, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75 percent. This is consistent with the rate assumed for 2006 and 2005. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long term investment periods of 10, 15 and 20 years, our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of 7.8 percent, 8.7 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively. Considering these long term results, we selected an 8.75 percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of January 1, 2007. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 80 percent equity securities and 20 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2006, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.75 percent, an increase of one quarter of one percent from the 5.50 percent rate used at December 31, 2005. Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.75 percent for the discount rate and 8.75 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2007 to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2007 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense to pension expense (dollars in millions) from current assumptions from current assumptions Discount rate Rate of Return on Plan Assets 5.00 percent $ 4.9 8.00 percent $ 3.6 5.25 percent 3.2 8.25 percent 2.4 5.50 percent 1.6 8.50 percent 1.2 5.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 8.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (1.6 ) 9.00 percent (1.2 ) 6.25 percent (3.1 ) 9.25 percent (2.4 ) 6.50 percent (4.6 ) 9.50 percent (3.6 ) In accordance with FAS No. 158, the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate. Total increase (decrease) in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (dollars in millions) Income, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 5.00 percent $ (32.8 ) 5.25 percent (21.3 ) 5.50 percent (10.4 ) 5.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent 9.8 6.25 percent 19.1 6.50 percent 27.9 16 Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $603.7 million as of December 31, 2006. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 will apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances, and is effective beginning after December 31, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS No. 157 on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We will be required to recognize, in our financial statements, the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the position as of the reporting date. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on new disclosure requirements, reporting and accrual of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and transition. FIN 48 is effective beginning January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 48 recognized as a change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard and upon implementation do not expect a material impact to the financial statements. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; operating results and cash flows from acquisitions may differ from what we anticipate; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs, availability, and terms, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource system; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with 17 the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
