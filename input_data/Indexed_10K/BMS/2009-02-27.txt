ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis Three Years Ended December 31, 2008 Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Three year review of results (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 3,779.4 100.0 % $ 3,649.3 100.0 % $ 3,639.4 100.0 % Cost of products sold 3,131.4 82.9 2,973.3 81.5 2,942.7 80.9 Gross margin 648.0 17.1 676.0 18.5 696.7 19.1 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 342.7 9.1 341.6 9.4 336.4 9.2 All other expenses 42.8 1.1 48.5 1.3 74.5 2.0 Income before income taxes 262.5 6.9 285.9 7.8 285.8 7.9 Provision for income taxes 96.3 2.5 104.3 2.9 109.5 3.1 Net income $ 166.2 4.4 % $ 181.6 5.0 % $ 176.3 4.8 % Effective income tax rate 36.7 % 36.5 % 38.3 % 10 Table of Contents Overview Bemis Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Generally about 60 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn and garden. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 83 percent of our net sales. The remaining 17 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our leading flexible packaging market positions in North and South America reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added, proprietary products. We also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins, films, paper, ink, and adhesives. Market Conditions During 2008, economic conditions continued to weaken and global financial markets experienced a significant liquidity crisis. Governments around the world have responded to the financial crisis with funding support for their regional financial systems. Consumer spending declined and unemployment in the United States increased. The housing and automotive markets continue to be weak. Commodity prices hit historically high levels during the second and third quarters of 2008, resulting in increased raw material and energy costs for manufacturers. Some of the commodity grade raw material costs steadily decreased throughout the fourth quarter as the global financial crisis widened. Our raw material costs hit historic highs during the year, but by the end of the year certain material costs had declined to early 2007 levels. While lower raw material costs benefit operating profit on a short term basis, our selling prices will decrease to reflect these lower costs over a few months. Restructuring and Related Charges In January 2006, we announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. These efforts were substantially complete as of December 31, 2006. Total remaining costs incurred in 2007 were substantially offset by restructuring related gains. Restructuring and related charges incurred in 2006 totaled $31.2 million, of which $12.9 million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold. The remaining $18.3 million primarily reflected employee related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs (income). Acquisitions In April 2006, we acquired the remaining shares of our three majority owned joint ventures in Mexico for $6.8 million. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 3,779.4 $ 3,649.3 $ 3,639.4 Net income 166.2 181.6 176.3 Diluted earnings per share 1.65 1.74 1.65 2008 versus 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, net sales increased 3.6 percent, reflecting increased raw material costs incorporated into higher selling prices during the year. Unit volume sold into certain food packaging markets increased compared to 2007, while unit volumes declined in advertising, display film, and construction related markets that are more sensitive to economic conditions. Currency translation benefits increased net sales by 1.7 percent. Diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for 2008, a 5.2 percent decrease compared to $1.74 per share for 2007. In 2007, diluted earnings per share included $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries. Higher raw material costs in 2008 negatively impacted gross margins. 2007 versus 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2007, net sales increased 0.3 percent, reflecting a net sales benefit from currency translation of 3.4 percent, offset by a 3.1 percent decrease in net sales related to lower unit sales volume. Diluted earnings per share were $1.74 for 2007, including a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries. In 2006, diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for 2006, including $0.18 per share of restructuring and related charges. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, medical devices, bakery, and dry foods. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. Selling price changes lag behind changes in our raw material costs. During 2008, resin costs dramatically increased during the second and third quarters. Certain commodity resin costs subsequently decreased during the fourth quarter. The magnitude and frequency of these cost changes negatively impacted operating profit during 2008. 11 Table of Contents In January of 2006, we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment. These efforts were substantially completed by December 31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled $29.0 million in 2006. (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 3,153.2 $ 3,001.8 $ 3,000.1 Operating profit (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 315.9 346.6 335.1 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 10.0 % 11.5 % 11.2 % 2008 versus 2007 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 5.0 percent in 2008, principally reflecting the impact of higher selling prices. Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 1.4 percent during 2008. Increases in net sales of packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, bakery products, and medical products markets reflected higher unit volume. These markets represent approximately 48 percent of total flexible packaging net sales. Net sales also increased in packaging for dry foods, health and hygiene, and industrial product markets, driven primarily by higher selling prices. These markets represent approximately 22 percent of flexible packaging net sales. We experienced lower net sales in the remaining 30 percent of our flexible packaging market categories as a result of lower unit volume. These lower volume markets include confectionery and snack markets, pet products, overwrap film for bottled water, frozen foods, lawn and garden, and protective display films. Non discretionary food markets have historically provided defensive characteristics during times of economic weakness. Markets for protective display films and packaging for discretionary food and consumer products have been negatively impacted during the recent economic downturn. We expect these trends to continue until the economy begins to strengthen and consumer confidence improves. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.0 percent in 2008 from 11.5 percent in 2007. Restructuring and related activities increased 2007 operating income by $1.5 million. Raw material prices increased substantially during the first eight months of 2008, and many specialty materials used in our food packaging products maintained those prices through the end of the year. Our method of passing these input costs on to customers through increased selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag and pressures operating profit margins during that period. 2007 versus 2006 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment were virtually unchanged from 2006 to 2007. A benefit from currency translation of 3.1 percent was completely offset by weak demand across many of our packaging markets. Net sales of packaging for meat and cheese, which represent about 30 percent of our flexible packaging net sales, decreased about 3 percent excluding the impact of currency. Packaging for bakery products and dry foods, for which consumer demand has been impacted by increased wheat prices, experienced a drop in net sales of about 10 percent from 2006 levels. Packaging for pet products and industrial products also decreased over 9 percent in 2007. Packaging for bakery, dry foods, pet products, and industrial products represents about 17 percent of flexible packaging net sales. Growth in other flexible packaging markets representing a combined 17 percent of total flexible packaging net sales substantially offset the impact of these decreases. Packaging for dairy and liquid products and overwrap for bottled beverages each increased by about 11 percent. Net sales of medical device packaging increased almost 6 percent compared to 2006, despite a slowdown related to a period of manufacturing shutdown during 2007 in order to move equipment to a new facility in Northern Ireland. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.5 percent in 2007 from 11.2 percent in 2006. Restructuring and related activities resulted in $1.5 million of operating income in 2007 and a $29.0 million reduction in operating profit in 2006. During 2007, operating profit was negatively impacted by the lower unit sales volume noted in the previous paragraph and a steady increase in raw material costs. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. In January of 2006, we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. This effort was completed by December 31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges incurred for this business segment totaled $1.0 million in 2006. These costs were primarily employee related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs (income), net. (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 626.2 $ 647.5 $ 639.3 Operating profit (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 34.3 40.3 50.1 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 5.5 % 6.2 % 7.8 % 12 Table of Contents 2008 versus 2007 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 3.3 percent in 2008, reflecting a benefit from currency translation of 2.8 percent which was more than offset by lower unit sales. Unit volumes declined in each of our pressure sensitive product lines, partially offset by increased label products prices and improved sales mix for technical products. Our label and graphic product lines represent 88 percent of our 2008 pressure sensitive materials net sales. Demand for these products in the discretionary consumer and advertising markets declined during the recent global economic downturn. Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting decreased unit sales volumes across all product lines. Due to the nature of the markets served by this business segment, we expect operating profit as a percent of net sales to continue to decline until global economic conditions improve. 2007 versus 2006 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of 1.3 percent in 2007, reflecting a benefit from currency translation of 4.5 percent, substantially offset by lower unit sales for label and technical products. Increased industry capacity for label products dampened unit sales volume and pricing during 2007, resulting in a 4 percent decrease in net sales of label products, excluding the impact of currency. Technical product net sales decreased by over 8 percent as customers faced economic challenges associated with the housing and medical markets. Graphic product net sales increased by about 5 percent during 2007. Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting decreased sales of value added technical products and a lower margin sales mix in our graphic product sales. Consolidated Gross Margin (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin $ 648.0 $ 676.0 $ 696.7 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales 17.1 % 18.5 % 19.1 % Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $0.3 million in 2007 and $12.9 million in 2006. There were no restructuring charges during 2008. The time lag between increases in raw material costs and the implementation of related selling price increases negatively impacted gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented. In addition, lower production volume associated with weak consumer demand for products in our markets reduced fixed cost absorption during 2007 and 2008. The impact of these cost pressures was partially offset by ongoing initiatives to improve production efficiency and cost management during the same timeframe. Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 342.7 $ 341.6 $ 336.4 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 9.1 % 9.4 % 9.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses have remained relatively stable over the past few years, reflecting managements focus on cost management. The decline in the ratio of these expenses to net sales was driven by higher selling prices included in net sales over these time periods. Other Expenses (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Research and development (R&D) $ 25.0 $ 26.0 $ 25.0 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense $ 39.4 $ 50.3 $ 49.3 Other costs (income), net (27.6 ) (31.5 ) (3.3 ) Minority interest in net income 6.0 3.7 3.5 Income taxes 96.3 104.3 109.5 Effective tax rate 36.7 % 36.5 % 38.3 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $10.9 million during 2008, reflecting lower levels of debt outstanding and lower average interest rates. The percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is 55 percent in 2008, 64 percent in 2007, and 59 percent in 2006. The effective interest rate was 4.8 percent in 2008, 5.9 percent in 2007, and 5.9 percent in 2006. 13 Table of Contents Other Costs (Income), Net In 2008, other costs (income) included $33.5 million of financial income, about 40 percent of which relates to interest income on cash held at non U.S. locations. The use of cash on hand for debt reduction during the fourth quarter of 2008 is expected to result in lower interest income during 2009. The remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are expected to continue to grow at a modest pace over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region. Transaction losses on foreign currency totaling $6.8 million offset financial income in 2008. Of this total, $6.1 million of transaction losses were recorded during the fourth quarter as dramatic changes in currency exchange rates occurred as a result of the global financial crisis. In 2007, other costs (income) included $28.3 million of financial income, about half of which related to interest income on cash held at non U.S. locations. In 2006, other costs (income) included $18.3 million of restructuring and related charges, which were more than offset by financial income of $18.0 million and a $4.5 million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability. Minority Interest in Net Income Minority interest in net income is primarily associated with the accounting for the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga, our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary. Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate of 36.7 percent in 2008, 36.5 percent in 2007, and 38.3 percent in 2006 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. The lower effective tax rates in 2008 and 2007 as compared to 2006 reflect benefits related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, the increasing impact of U.S. tax incentives for manufacturing companies, and a change in the geographic mix of pretax income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity In the second half of 2008, global financial markets experienced a liquidity crisis. This crisis resulted in a substantial reduction in available funding for commercial banks and corporate debt issuers. Governments around the world have responded with funding support for their regional financial systems. Despite this government intervention, capital market financing has become less available and more expensive. We use commercial paper to finance our daily operations. Our strong balance sheet and short term A 1/P 2 credit ratings have preserved our ability to access the commercial paper market at a reasonable cost. If the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us, we would expect to use our revolving bank credit facilities to finance our operations until the commercial paper market is restored or alternative financing can be arranged. Debt to Total Capitalization Debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt, long term deferred tax liabilities and equity) was 32.0 percent at December 31, 2008, compared to 32.9 percent at December 31, 2007 and 33.0 percent at December 31, 2006. Improvement in this ratio was driven by debt repayments, partially offset by reductions to stockholders equity for pension and currency translation effects. Total debt was $686.6 million, $843.3 million, and $789.8 million at year end 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned Bemis Company long term credit ratings of A from Standard & Poors and Baa1 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A 1 and Prime 2 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. Net Cash Flow from Operations Net cash provided by operations was $293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $406.2 million in 2007 and $349.0 million in 2006. During 2008, cash flow was negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher levels of working capital compared to 2007. Working capital increases during 2008 reflect the impact of higher raw material costs on inventory and increased selling prices on accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operations in the year ended December 31, 2006, was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $24.0 million. Contributions of $2.3 million and $1.1 million were made to our U.S. pension plans in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2009. We expect to fund this contribution with cash provided by operations. Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $330.8 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the global financial crisis threatened to eliminate liquidity in the commercial paper market. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility. Under the terms of our revolving credit agreements, we have the capacity to borrow up to $625 million, of which $425 million matures April 28, 2013, and $200 million matures April 28, 2009. These facilities are primarily used to support our issuance of commercial paper. Our revolving credit facilities are supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by these revolving credit facilities include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreements include a combined $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. In addition, we have arrangements in place to issue up to $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short term instruments whose 14 Table of Contents maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2008, the ECN market was unavailable due to unfavorable market conditions. If these revolving credit facilities and ECNs were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up credit agreement expires on April 28, 2013. On August 15, 2008, notes totaling $250 million matured and were repaid using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. On December 31, 2008, our revolving credit facilities supported total commercial paper outstanding of $330.8 million, industrial revenue bond outstanding of $8.0 million, and multicurrency loans outstanding of $5.8 million. As a result, we had the capacity to borrow an additional $280.4 million under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008. Of this available liquidity, $200 million of revolving credit facilities mature on April 28, 2009. While cash flows from operations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash obligations projected for 2009, we will continue to evaluate the need to refinance this excess revolving credit capacity in light of existing capital market conditions and updated liquidity needs. Liquidity Outlook Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment or the recent economic slowdown, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by ongoing capital market disruptions. In addition, substantial increases in raw material costs could increase our short term liquidity needs. Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $120.5 million during 2008, compared to $178.9 million in 2007, and $158.8 million in 2006. Capital expenditures during the years presented supported multiyear investments for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets, a platform for rigid polyester packaging products, additional converting equipment in our Malaysian operation, proprietary film production capacity for European markets, and a new enterprise resource planning system. Capital expenditures for 2009 are estimated to be approximately $105 million. Over the long term, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4.8 percent during the first quarter of 2008 to 22 cents per share from 21 cents per share. This follows increases of 10.5 percent in 2007 and 5.6 percent in 2006. In February 2009, the Board of Directors approved the 26th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 22.5 cents per share, a 2.3 percent increase. Share Repurchases During 2008, we purchased 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market. During 2007, we purchased 5.15 million shares of common stock, of which 4.0 million shares were repurchased in conjunction with an accelerated share repurchase program. The remaining 1.15 million shares were purchased in the open market. During 2006, we purchased 0.6 million shares of common stock in the open market. As of December 31, 2008, we were authorized to purchase up to 4.1 million additional shares of common stock for the treasury. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2008. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt payments (1) $ 686.6 $ 26.6 $ 21.1 $ 638.9 $ 0.0 Interest expense (2) 91.9 26.8 49.8 15.3 0.0 Capital leases (3) 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases (4) 25.6 6.8 8.6 4.5 5.8 Purchase obligations (5) 149.1 146.8 1.4 0.1 0.8 Postretirement obligations (6) 53.0 4.4 15.9 12.6 20.1 Pursuant to the application of FIN 48, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on April 28, 2013. (2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December 31, 2008. 15 Table of Contents (3) Amount noted also includes estimated interest costs. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations. (4) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (5) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (6) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations. Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2007, our long term unsecured notes included $250 million due in August 2008. In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expired on the date the related notes matured in August 2008, reduced the interest cost of the notes from 6.5 percent to about 6.0 percent in 2008 and 6.0 percent in 2007. Since these variable rates are based upon six month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) require that the fair value of these swaps, which were designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $3.3 million at December 31, 2007. An offsetting increase was recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding. This fair value adjustment did not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor did it impact the income statement or related cash flows. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public notes, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. Interest expense on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $380.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by $3.8 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. Our business in Brazil holds U.S. dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $24.6 million and $49.6 million, respectively. The net settlement amounts (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the underlying debt and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and were not significant at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $60.5 million in 2008 and $123.2 million in 2007. Operating profit improved by approximately $5.9 million in 2008 and $9.6 million in 2007 as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation. Stockholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2008 was a reduction in stockholders equity totaling $183.2 million. 16 Table of Contents The majority of our pension liabilities are funded with assets that are invested in equity and fixed income securities whose market values are readily available from published market sources. During 2008, the market value of these assets declined in conjunction with the global economic downturn. This decline in market value is the principal reason that pension expense in 2009 is expected to increase by approximately $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, the unfunded portion of our pension liabilities increased by $164.1 million compared to the balance as of December 31, 2007. The after tax impact of this increased liability is a charge to other comprehensive income of $99.5 million, which is reflected as reduction in stockholders equity at December 31, 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with FAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended by FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. FAS No. 158 requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Net periodic pension costs recorded in 2008 was $10.5 million, compared to pension cost of $15.2 million in 2007 and $17.7 million in 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two thirds of the participant population. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. As a result, future pension liability is no longer adjusted for additional years of service for those employees impacted by the amendment and the related service cost and pension expense have decreased. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets. As of January 1, 2008, in conjunction with a change in the allocation of the U.S. pension assets to equity investments from 80 percent to 70 percent of total assets, we reduced our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 8.50 percent. For the years 2006 and 2007, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 80 percent of total assets and had assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 8.75 percent. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December 31, 2008, our pension plan assets have earned annualized rates of return of 0.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7.7 percent, and 8.9 percent, respectively. This is a substantial decline from the annualized long term investment returns as of December 31, 2007 of 6.3 percent, 9.0 percent, 9.8 percent and 10.5 percent. This decline reflects substantially lower investment market values on U.S. pension assets during 2008. Considering these long term results, we further reduced our expected return on assets assumption to 8.25 percent as of January 1, 2009. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2008, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 6.00 percent, a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the 6.25 percent rate used at December 31, 2007. 17 Table of Contents Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 6.00 percent for the discount rate and 8.25 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2009 to be in a range of $18 million to $23 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2009 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense to pension expense (dollars in millions) from current assumptions from current assumptions Discount rate Rate of Return on Plan Assets 5.25 percent $ 3.6 7.50 percent $ 3.4 5.50 percent 2.4 7.75 percent 2.2 5.75 percent 1.1 8.00 percent 1.1 6.00 percent Current Assumption 0.0 8.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.25 percent (1.1 ) 8.50 percent (1.1 ) 6.50 percent (2.2 ) 8.75 percent (2.2 ) 6.75 percent (3.4 ) 9.00 percent (3.4 ) In accordance with FAS No. 158, the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate. Total increase (decrease) in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (dollars in millions) Income, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 5.25 percent $ (45.5 ) 5.50 percent (29.7 ) 5.75 percent (14.5 ) 6.00 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.25 percent 13.7 6.50 percent 26.9 6.75 percent 39.6 Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $595.5 million as of December 31, 2008. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)), which provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP FAS 132(R) on our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan note disclosures. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), which clarified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities, and thus, should be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share (EPS). As discussed in Note 7, nonforfeitable dividend equivalent payments are made during the grant period on outstanding, unvested performance units. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning 18 Table of Contents after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years, and requires that all prior period EPS data be adjusted retroactively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP EITF 03 6 1 on our calculation and disclosure of basic and diluted EPS. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As this guidance applies only to assets we may acquire in the future, we are not able to predict the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, The Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. For the Company, FAS No. 161 will be effective at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year and will result in additional disclosures in notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160), which amends ARB No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 160 on our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The new standard also requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred. FAS 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, any business combination we enter into and or close after December 31, 2008, will be subject to this new standard. Beginning January 1, 2009, the Company will expense all acquisition related costs as incurred as well as any capitalized costs related to business combinations that were in process, but not completed by the effective date of FAS 141(R). In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The standard was effective for the Company on January 1, 2008 and, as permitted, the Company has not elected the fair value option for its financial assets and financial liabilities. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 will apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances. In early 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157 2, which delays by one year the effective date of FAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis. The Company adopted FAS 157 on January 1, 2008, as required, with no effect on the measurement of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities or on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to non financial assets and non financial liabilities in years after 2008. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 19 Table of Contents Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs and availability, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; changes in the availability of financing; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource system; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
