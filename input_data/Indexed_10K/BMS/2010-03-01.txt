ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis Three Years Ended December 31, 2009 Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Three year review of results (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 3,514.6 100.0 % $ 3,779.4 100.0 % $ 3,649.3 100.0 % Cost of products sold 2,814.4 80.1 3,131.4 82.9 2,973.3 81.5 Gross margin 700.2 19.9 648.0 17.1 676.0 18.5 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 370.9 10.5 342.7 9.0 341.6 9.4 All other expenses 89.0 2.5 36.8 1.0 44.8 1.2 Income before income taxes 240.3 6.8 268.5 7.1 289.6 7.9 Provision for income taxes 87.8 2.5 96.3 2.5 104.3 2.8 Net income 152.5 4.3 172.2 4.6 185.3 5.1 Less: net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests 5.3 0.1 6.0 0.2 3.7 0.1 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. $ 147.2 4.2 % $ 166.2 4.4 % $ 181.6 5.0 % Effective income tax rate 36.5 % 35.9 % 36.0 % Overview Bemis Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Approximately 60 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include applications for medical devices, personal care, and lawn and garden. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 85 percent of our net sales. The remaining 15 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets such as advertising, housing, and automotive. The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our leading flexible packaging market positions in North and South America reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added, proprietary products. We also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals. Market Conditions The global financial crisis which started late in 2008 continued to dampen consumer demand in many regions around the world during 2009. While the majority of our products are sold for more resilient food applications, our customers who operate in the advertising, automotive, housing, and industrial product markets experienced weakness in demand for their products throughout the year. In the food and grocery products markets, we experienced lower unit sales volumes but benefited from consumer trends that have prioritized value added products. Polymer resins, the primary raw materials used in our flexible packaging business segment, experienced significant volatility in recent years. Our 2009 operating performance benefited from a temporary margin increase as raw material costs decreased ahead of contractual selling price adjustments. During the last half of 2009, resin costs were relatively stable and the majority of our contract selling prices had adjusted to reflect the change in input costs. Subsequent Event Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas On March 1, 2010, Bemis completed the acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of international mining group Rio Tinto plc, for $1.2 billion. The acquisition will expand our global presence with 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand. These flexible packaging facilities, while owned by Rio Tinto plc, recorded net sales of $1.4 billion in 2009 to the food and beverage markets and include expertise in foil and crystallized polyester technologies. In compliance with regulatory requirements for approval of the transaction in the United States, Bemis is obligated to divest certain Alcan Packaging Food Americas packaging assets in the United States within a specified time period after the closing date. The packaging assets that will be divested produced annual sales of approximately $100 million in 2009 and include manufacturing equipment used to produce packaging for fresh meat and retail natural cheese products. The majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of 2009 through the issuance of $800.0 million of public bonds and 8.2 million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market in advance of closing. 13 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (in millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 3,514.6 $ 3,779.4 $ 3,649.3 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. 147.2 166.2 181.6 Diluted earnings per share 1.38 1.61 1.70 2009 versus 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, net sales decreased 7.0 percent. The effect of currency translation decreased net sales by 3.3 percent in 2009, while the June 2009 acquisition of a flexible packaging company in South America contributed 1.3 percent to net sales growth. Net of these impacts, the decline in net sales during 2009 primarily reflects lower unit sales volumes in both business segments. Diluted earnings per share were $1.38 for 2009, a 14.3 percent decrease compared to $1.61 per share for 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, an administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offset by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009 benefited from an increased proportion of net sales of value added products and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year. 2008 versus 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, net sales increased 3.6 percent, reflecting increased raw material costs incorporated into higher selling prices during the year. Unit volume sold into certain food packaging markets increased compared to 2007, while unit volumes declined in advertising, display film, and construction related markets that are more sensitive to economic conditions. Currency translation benefits increased net sales by 1.7 percent. Diluted earnings per share were $1.61 for 2008, a 5.3 percent decrease compared to $1.70 per share for 2007. In 2007, diluted earnings per share included $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries. Higher raw material costs in 2008 negatively impacted gross margins. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including packaging for products such as meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, medical devices, bakery, and dry foods. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture multilayer film products. Our method of passing on input cost changes to customers through regularly adjusted contractual selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag. This methodology creates a short term, negative impact on operating profit margins during periods of rapid raw material cost increases and a short term, positive impact on operating profit margins during periods of rapid raw materials cost declines. Raw material costs have been quite volatile over the past few years. During the first half of 2008, raw material costs increased substantially, negatively impacting operating margins during 2008. This was followed by rapid decreases in raw material costs which benefited operating margins during the first half of 2009. Raw material costs were relatively stable during the latter half of 2009. Acquisition of South American Rigid Packaging Operations of Huhtamaki Oyj On June 3, 2009, Bemis acquired the South American rigid packaging operations of Huhtamaki Oyj, a global manufacturer of consumer and specialty packaging. This rigid packaging business, which includes three facilities in Brazil and one facility in Argentina, recorded annual net sales of approximately $86 million in 2008, primarily to dairy and food service markets. The purchase price of $43.0 million was paid with a combination of $32.3 million cash on hand, $1.9 million of debt assumed, and an $8.8 million note payable to the seller, the majority of which was paid during 2009. (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,983.4 $ 3,153.2 $ 3,001.8 Operating profit (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 385.3 315.9 346.6 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 12.9 % 10.0 % 11.5 % 2009 versus 2008 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment decreased 5.4 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a sales decline of 3.3 percent compared to 2008 and the operations of Huhtamaki Oyj, acquired in June 2009, accounted for $49.6 million of 2009 net sales following the acquisition, increasing net sales by 1.6 percent. The remaining 3.7 percent decrease in net sales reflects both lower selling prices and unit sales volume. Generally lower net sales of flexible packaging for markets such as meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, pet food, bakery products, overwrap for bottled beverages, health and hygiene, and industrial products reflects decreased consumer demand for products in those areas. These market segment applications represent approximately 70 percent of our total flexible packaging net sales and offset modestly higher net sales of value added packaging applications in other market segments such as dairy, liquids, and medical products. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9 percent in 2009 from 10.0 percent in 2008. This improvement reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix and production efficiency initiatives, as well as lower input costs experienced during the first half of 2009. The improvement in sales mix during 2009 is attributable to an increased proportion of net sales represented by value added packaging which incorporates consumer convenience features and extends shelf life. Net sales of packaging for less complex 14 Table of Contents applications generally experienced the largest unit volume decrease during 2009. In comparison, operating margins during 2008 were negatively impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs during the summer months. 2008 versus 2007 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 5.0 percent in 2008, principally reflecting the impact of higher selling prices. Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 1.4 percent during 2008. Increases in net sales of packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, bakery products, and medical products markets reflected higher unit volume. These markets represent approximately 48 percent of total flexible packaging net sales. Net sales also increased in packaging for dry foods, health and hygiene, and industrial product markets, driven primarily by higher selling prices. These markets represent approximately 22 percent of flexible packaging net sales. We experienced lower net sales in the remaining 30 percent of our flexible packaging market categories as a result of lower unit volume. These lower volume markets include confectionery and snack markets, pet products, overwrap film for bottled water, frozen foods, lawn and garden, and protective display films. Non discretionary food markets have historically provided defensive characteristics during times of economic weakness. Markets for protective display films and packaging for discretionary food and consumer products have been negatively impacted during the recent economic downturn. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.0 percent in 2008 from 11.5 percent in 2007. Restructuring and related activities increased 2007 operating income by $1.5 million. Raw material prices increased substantially during the first eight months of 2008, and many specialty materials used in our food packaging products maintained those prices through the end of the year. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products through three product lines: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 531.2 $ 626.2 $ 647.5 Operating profit (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 13.6 34.3 40.3 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 5.5 % 6.2 % 2009 versus 2008 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 15.2 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 3.2 percent. The balance of the decrease reflects dramatically lower unit sales volumes compared to 2008. The markets for our graphic and technical products, which represent about 40 percent of total business segment sales, have experienced significant demand declines in light of weak global economic conditions, resulting in net sales declines for those products in excess of 20.0 percent. Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting the decline in unit sales volumes, particularly in high value added graphic and technical product lines. Operating profit in 2009 includes severance charges totaling $2.6 million related to workforce reductions intended to better match capacity levels with current production needs. 2008 versus 2007 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 3.3 percent in 2008, reflecting a benefit from currency translation of 2.8 percent which was more than offset by lower unit sales. Unit volumes declined in each of our pressure sensitive product lines, partially offset by increased label products prices and improved sales mix for technical products. Our label and graphic product lines represent 88 percent of our 2008 pressure sensitive materials net sales. Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting decreased unit sales volumes across all product lines. Consolidated Gross Margin (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 700.2 $ 648.0 $ 676.0 Gross margin as a percentage of net sales 19.9 % 17.1 % 18.5 % Improved sales mix, production efficiency initiatives, and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year, each contributed to the improved gross margin in 2009. Input costs moderated during the second half of 2009, reducing the positive impact of the contractual lag in selling price adjustments. Improved sales mix throughout 2009 was driven by increased sales of value added flexible packaging products. Gross margins in 2008 were negatively impacted by dramatic, short lived raw material cost increases during the year. 15 Table of Contents Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 370.9 $ 342.7 $ 341.6 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 10.5 % 9.0 % 9.4 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in 2009 primarily as a result of higher benefit and incentive plan costs during the year. The increase in the ratio of these expenses to net sales in 2009 was magnified by lower sales levels for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other Expenses (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Research and development (R&D) $ 24.3 $ 25.0 $ 26.0 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense 42.1 39.4 50.3 Effective interest rate 4.3 % 4.8 % 5.9 % Other costs (income), net 22.6 (27.7 ) (31.5 ) Income taxes 87.8 96.3 104.3 Effective tax rate 36.5 % 35.9 % 36.0 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $2.7 million during 2009. Interest expense includes interest costs of $21.3 million associated with public bonds issued in July of 2009 to finance the acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business. The percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is 13 percent in 2009, 55 percent in 2008, and 64 percent in 2007. Variable interest rates remained low in 2009, and we dedicated our excess cash flow to debt reduction throughout the year. Other Costs (Income), Net For the year ended December 31, 2009, other costs and income included $44.8 million of acquisition related professional fees and related expenses associated with the acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business. Financial income recorded in 2009 was $20.2 million, compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in financial income primarily reflects a decline in interest income from lower cash balances invested outside of the United States in 2009. Financial income also includes fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are expected to continue over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region. Net foreign exchange gains totaled $1.4 million in 2009 compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $6.8 million in 2008. During 2009, other costs and income also included a $5.1 million accrual for an administrative sales tax assessment and a gain of $3.6 million on the sale of a property. In 2007, other costs (income) included $28.3 million of financial income, about half of which related to interest income on cash held at non U.S. locations. Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate of 36.5 percent in 2009, 35.9 percent in 2008, and 36.0 percent in 2007 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interest primarily represents the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga, our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary. Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt to Total Capitalization Debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt, long term deferred tax liabilities, and equity) was 38.8 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 31.5 percent at December 31, 2008, and 32.4 percent at December 31, 2007. Total debt was $1,258.8 million, $686.6 million, and $843.3 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in debt during 2009 reflects $800.0 million of public bonds issued in July 2009 in anticipation of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition, net of a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding. Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned Bemis Company long term investment grade credit ratings of BBB from Standard & Poors and Baa1 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A 2 and Prime 2 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. Our ratings have been revised to reflect the impact of 16 Table of Contents the additional debt issued to finance the acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. Net Cash Flow from Operations Net cash provided by operations was $475.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $293.6 million in 2008 and $406.2 million in 2007. During 2009, an emphasis on aggressive cost management, production efficiency, and working capital management all contributed to this improvement in cash flow. Net cash provided by operations was reduced by a voluntary pension contribution to our U.S. pension plans of $30.0 million in 2009. Contributions of $2.3 million and $1.1 million were made to our U.S. pension plans in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $20 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2010. We expect to fund this contribution with cash provided by operations. Acquisition Financing On July 27, 2009, we issued $400.0 million of bonds due in 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 5.7 percent and $400.0 million of bonds due in 2019 with a fixed interest rate of 6.8 percent. The proceeds of these bonds were used as partial funding of the acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business completed on March 1, 2010. During the third quarter of 2009, we issued 8.2 million shares of common stock through a public stock offering. The $202.8 million of net proceeds from this stock offering was also used as partial funding of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market in advance of closing. Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $90.5 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. As of December 31, 2009, Bemis had available from its banks a $425.0 million revolving credit facility. This credit facility is used principally as back up for our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreement includes a combined $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. Upon completion of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business acquisition on March 1, 2010, an amendment to the revolving credit facility became effective, increasing credit available and therefore total commercial paper capacity from $425.0 million to $625.0 million. If this revolving credit facility were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up credit agreement expires on April 28, 2013. Liquidity Outlook On December 31, 2009, our revolving credit facilities supported total commercial paper outstanding of $90.5 million, industrial revenue bonds outstanding of $8.0 million, and multicurrency loans outstanding of $17.7 million. As a result, we had the capacity to borrow an additional $308.8 million under the credit facility as of December 31, 2009. In connection with the completion of the acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas on March 1, 2010, an amendment to our existing revolving credit facility became effective and increased our available credit by $200.0 million. This amended balance of available credit, combined with future cash flows from operations, are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash obligations projected for 2010, including acquisition related payments. Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. We do not expect our liquidity needs to be materially impacted by the completion of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. In addition, substantial increases in raw material costs could increase our short term liquidity needs. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $89.2 million during 2009, compared to $120.5 million in 2008, and $178.9 million in 2007. Spending levels for 2008 and 2009 reflect the positive impact of improved capacity utilization initiatives combined with a general slowdown in sales volume. During 2007, we completed a multiyear investment for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets, a platform for formable, rigid packaging products, additional converting equipment in our Malaysian operation, and proprietary film production capacity for European markets. Over the long term, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2010 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2.3 percent during the first quarter of 2009 to 22.5 cents per share. This follows increases of 4.8 percent in 2008 and 10.5 percent in 2007. In February 2010, the Board of Directors approved the 27th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 23 cents per share, a 2.2 percent increase. 17 Table of Contents Share Repurchases No shares were repurchased during 2009. During 2008, we purchased 1.0 million shares of common stock. During 2007, we purchased 5.15 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2009, we were authorized to purchase up to 4.1 million additional shares of common stock for the treasury. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2009. Capital leases are insignificant. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long term debt obligations (1) $ 1,251.8 $ 22.5 $ 321.1 508.2 $ 400.0 Interest expense (2) 404.7 67.2 121.6 90.7 125.2 Operating leases (3) 23.5 6.4 7.8 4.5 4.8 Purchase obligations (4) 178.1 176.9 0.3 0.1 0.8 Postretirement obligations (5) 54.5 5.1 16.7 12.6 20.1 Pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on April 28, 2013. (2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December 31, 2009. (3) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (5) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations. Interest Rate Swaps In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. These interest rate swap agreements, which expired on the date the related notes matured in August 2008, reduced the interest cost of the notes from 6.5 percent to about 6.0 percent in 2008 and 2007. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. A portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $123.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by $1.2 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $18.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. Our business in Brazil holds U.S. dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We have not designated these 18 Table of Contents derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $18.4 million and $24.6 million, respectively. The net settlement amounts (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the underlying debt and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and were not significant at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was a decrease of $125.8 million in 2009 and an increase of $60.5 million in 2008. Operating profit decreased by approximately $9.4 million in 2009 and improved by $5.9 million in 2008 as a result of foreign currency translation. Stockholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2009 was an increase in stockholders equity totaling $158.6 million. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Pension costs Amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Net periodic pension cost recorded in 2009 was $18.8 million, compared to pension cost of $10.5 million in 2008 and $15.2 million in 2007. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets. For the year 2009, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 70 percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. For the historical long term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December 31, 2009, our pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of 0.7 percent, 8.0 percent, 8.1 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2009, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.75 percent, a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the 6.00 percent rate used at December 31, 2008. 19 Table of Contents Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.75 percent for the discount rate and 8.25 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2010 to be in a range of $23 million to $27 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2010 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense to pension expense (dollars in millions) from current assumptions from current assumptions Discount rate Rate of Return on Plan Assets 5.00 percent $ 3.6 7.50 percent $ 3.3 5.25 percent 2.4 7.75 percent 2.3 5.50 percent 1.2 8.00 percent 1.1 5.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 8.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (1.1 ) 8.50 percent (1.1 ) 6.25 percent (2.2 ) 8.75 percent (2.3 ) 6.50 percent (3.3 ) 9.00 percent (3.3 ) The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate. Total increase (decrease) in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (dollars in millions) Income, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 5.00 percent $ (49.0 ) 5.25 percent (32.1 ) 5.50 percent (15.7 ) 5.75 percent Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent 14.8 6.25 percent 29.1 6.50 percent 42.6 Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. None of our reporting units with significant goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Goodwill was $646.9 million as of December 31, 2009. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition, and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Guidance Adopted in the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to establish principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. Guidance was also provided for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. This guidance was effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. During the second half of 2008, we incurred accounting, legal, and other professional fees associated with the Companys due diligence effort related to the Huhtamaki Oyj acquisition and the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. These costs were deferred in 2008 under the then existing accounting standards. Upon the adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2009, these costs were expensed. We incurred additional costs during the year ended December 31, 2009 which were expensed. The total 20 Table of Contents impact to our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of this due diligence effort was a pretax charge of $31.8 million, or a reduction in earnings per share of $0.19. Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Disclosures In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This guidance requires employers to disclose fair value measurements of plan assets, investment policies and strategies, and significant concentrations of risk. The guidance was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, and has expanded the disclosures related to our benefit plan assets. Earnings Per Share In June 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which clarified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities, and thus, must be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share. As discussed in Note 15, Earnings Per Share Computations, we adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for prior years presented has been recast to reflect this guidance. The impact of this modification was a $0.04 per share decrease in diluted earnings per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Noncontrolling Interests In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The guidance was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2009. As required, the presentation of minority interest is now referred to as noncontrolling interest and repositioned in the consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated statement of income, noncontrolling interest is now presented following a subtotal entitled Net income. In the consolidated balance sheet, noncontrolling interest is now presented as a component of total equity with a corresponding presentation in the consolidated statement of equity. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation in conformity with the requirements. Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance requires some new disclosures and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements. The majority of the guidance is effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. A portion of the guidance related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. This guidance will expand the Companys disclosures and will not impact its financial position or results of operations. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs and availability, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; changes in the availability of financing; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of an enterprise resource system; costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations, unexpected costs associated with acquisitions or divestitures; the inability to complete a planned acquisition or divestiture; changes in governmental regulations, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
