ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis Three Years Ended December 31, 2010 Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Three year review of results (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 4,835.0 100.0 % $ 3,514.6 100.0 % $ 3,779.4 100.0 % Cost of products sold 3,945.5 81.6 2,814.4 80.1 3,131.4 82.9 Gross margin 889.5 18.4 700.2 19.9 648.0 17.1 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 455.4 9.4 370.9 10.5 342.7 9.0 All other expenses 106.8 2.2 89.0 2.5 36.8 1.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 327.3 6.8 240.3 6.8 268.5 7.1 Provision for income taxes 117.6 2.4 87.8 2.5 96.3 2.5 Income from continuing operations 209.7 4.4 152.5 4.3 172.2 4.6 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 1.8 0.0 Net income 211.5 4.4 152.5 4.3 172.2 4.6 Less: net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests 6.4 0.2 5.3 0.1 6.0 0.2 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. $ 205.1 4.2 % $ 147.2 4.2 % $ 166.2 4.4 % Effective income tax rate 35.9 % 36.5 % 35.9 % Overview Bemis Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Generally about 65 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 90 percent of our net sales. Our remaining net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. Market Conditions The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins, films, paper, ink, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals. During 2010, the cost of these raw materials generally increased, creating a short term negative impact on gross margins as a percentage of net sales. This compares to an environment of decreasing raw material costs which created a short term positive impact on gross margins during 2009. Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas On March 1, 2010, Bemis completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, Bemis acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales totaling $1.4 billion. These facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment Bemis product offerings and technological capabilities. The majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of 2009 through the issuance of $800.0 million of public bonds and 8.2 million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market at the time of closing. Sale of Discontinued Operations Under the terms of an order signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 25, 2010, a portion of the Food Americas business acquired on March 1, 2010 was to be divested, and we have classified the related operating results as discontinued operations. On July 13, 2010, we sold these discontinued operations to Exopack Holding Corp., an affiliate of private investment firm Sun Capital Partners, Inc. The transaction was completed for a cash purchase price, net of selling costs, of $75.2 million. The divested business recorded 2009 net sales of approximately $156 million and included two facilities which manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 4,835.0 $ 3,514.6 $ 3,779.4 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. 205.1 147.2 166.2 Diluted earnings per share 1.85 1.38 1.61 11 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 37.6 percent. We estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 31 percent during the year. The effect of currency translations accounted for a 1.8 percent increase in net sales. Net of these impacts, the increase in net sales primarily reflects higher prices and improved unit sales volume from both existing and acquired operations. Selling prices were increased during 2010 in response to higher raw material costs. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 of $1.85 included a $0.09 charge for transaction related legal, accounting and other professional fees, a $0.09 charge associated with purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog, as well as a $0.05 charge for acquisition related integration costs including severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs. In addition, the pre closing impact of the July 2009 financing of the Food Americas acquisition reduced 2010 diluted earnings by $0.06 per share. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.02 in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, and an administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offse t by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 improved with increased unit sales volume, currency translation benefits, and the accretive effect of the Food Americas acquisition. 2009 versus 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, net sales decreased 7.0 percent. The effect of currency translation decreased net sales by 3.3 percent in 2009, while the June 2009 acquisition of a flexible packaging company in South America contributed 1.3 percent to net sales growth. Net of these impacts, the decline in net sales during 2009 primarily reflects lower unit sales volumes in both business segments. Diluted earnings per share were $1.38 for 2009, a 14.3 percent decrease compared to $1.61 per share for 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, and administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offset by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009 benefited from an increased proportion of net sales of value added products and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including applications for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, healthcare, bakery, and dry foods. (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 4,272.4 $ 2,983.4 $ 3,153.2 Operating profit (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 474.9 385.3 315.9 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 11.1 % 12.9 % 10.0 % 2010 versus 2009 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 43.2 percent in 2010. Acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 36 percent, and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of 2.4 percent. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher sales across many market categories. Operating profit increased to $474.9 million, or 11.1 percent of net sales, in 2010, compared to $385.3 million, or 12.9 percent of net sales in 2009. The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in 2010 by $6.5 million compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 reflects the combined impact of generally lower operating margins from the acquired business and the short term negative impact of higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments. In addition, operating profit includes $20.1 million of acquisition related charges. Operating margins in 2009 benefited from decreasing raw material costs during the first half of that year. 2009 versus 2008 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment decreased 5.4 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a sales decline of 3.3 percent compared to 2008 and the South American rigid operations of Huhtamaki Oyj, acquired in June 2009, accounted for $49.6 million of 2009 net sales following the acquisition, increasing net sales by 1.6 percent. The remaining 3.7 percent decrease in net sales reflects both lower selling prices and unit sales volume. Generally lower net sales of flexible packaging reflected decreased consumer demand. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9 percent in 2009 from 10.0 percent in 2008. This improvement reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix and production efficiency initiatives, as well as lower input costs experienced during the first half of 2009. The improvement in sales mix during 2009 is attributable to an increased proportion of net sales represented by value added packaging which incorporates consumer convenience features and extends shelf life. Net sales of packaging for less complex applications generally experienced the largest unit volume decrease during 2009. In comparison, operating margins during 2008 were negatively impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs during the summer months. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and 12 Table of Contents technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 562.6 $ 531.2 $ 626.2 Operating profit (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 33.0 13.6 34.3 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 5.9 % 2.6 % 5.5 % 2010 versus 2009 For the total year 2010, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $562.6 million, a 5.9 percent increase from net sales in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 1.6 percent. The resulting 7.5 percent increase in net sales reflects the increase in unit sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 when economic conditions negatively impacted demand for our pressure sensitive materials products. The net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit by $0.7 million in 2010. Higher operating profit in 2010 reflects the positive impact of substantially improved unit sales volumes combined with disciplined cost management. 2009 versus 2008 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 15.2 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 3.2 percent. The balance of the decrease reflects dramatically lower unit sales volumes compared to 2008. The markets for our graphic and technical products, which represent about 40 percent of total business segment sales, experienced significant demand declines in light of weak global economic conditions, resulting in net sales declines for those products in excess of 20.0 percent. Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting the decline in unit sales volumes, particularly in high value added graphic and technical product lines. Operating profit in 2009 includes severance charges totaling $2.6 million related to workforce reductions intended to better match capacity levels with current production needs. Consolidated Gross Profit (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross profit $ 889.5 $ 700.2 $ 648.0 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 18.4 % 19.9 % 17.1 % Gross profit in 2010 reflects the negative impact of $15.4 million of expenses associated with the purchase accounting impact of the fair value write up of inventory and a charge for the fair value of the customer order backlog, both related to the Food Americas acquisition. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 is attributable to lower operating margins in the newly acquired Food Americas business combined with increasing raw material costs during 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2009 benefited from declining raw material costs for the first half of that year, resulting in a substantial improvement in this ratio compared to 2008. Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 455.4 $ 370.9 $ 342.7 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 9.4 % 10.5 % 9.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased during 2010 reflecting the increased costs associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business, including $4.6 million of expenses primarily related to severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs. Expenses in 2009 increased from the prior year as a result of higher benefit and incentive plan costs during that year. The increase in the ratio of these expenses to net sales in 2009 was magnified by lower sales levels for the year ended December 31, 2009 as selling prices were adjusted downward to reflect decreasing raw material costs in 2009. Other Expenses (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Research and development (R&D) $ 34.3 $ 24.3 $ 25.0 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense 73.5 42.1 39.4 Effective interest rate 5.8 % 4.3 % 4.8 % Other operating (income) expense, net (1.0 ) 24.7 (14.0 ) Other non operating (income) expense, net (2.1 ) (13.7 ) Income taxes 117.6 87.8 96.3 13 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 Effective tax rate 35.9 % 36.5 % 35.9 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Interest Expense Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the July 2009 issuance of $800 million of long term bonds as financing for the Food Americas acquisition. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net For the year 2010, other operating income and expense included $15.9 million of fiscal incentive income compared to $16.6 million in 2009 and $19.8 million in 2008. Fiscal government incentives relate to certain flexible packaging locations and are considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are expected to continue over the next few years. In 2010, the fiscal incentive income was offset by $15.6 million of charges principally associated with the Food Americas acquisition. During 2009, in addition to the fiscal incentive income, other operating income and expense included $44.8 million of acquisition related expenses. Other Non operating (Income) Expense, Net The decrease in other non operating income, net, is primarily due to lower interest income combined with net foreign exchange losses in 2010. In 2008, increased levels of interest income reflected higher cash balances invested outside of the United States. Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate of 35.9 percent in 2010, 36.5 percent in 2009, and 35.9 percent in 2008 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga, our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary. Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt to Total Capitalization Net debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt net of cash balances plus equity) was 38.9 percent at December 31, 2010, compared to 39.2 percent at December 31, 2009, and 31.7 percent at December 31, 2008. The December 31, 2009 calculation of net debt to total capitalization excluded $1.0 billion of cash on hand related to the acquisition financing proceeds received in advance of the March 1, 2010 closing of the Food Americas acquisition. Total debt was $1,286.5 million, $1,258.8 million, and $686.6 million, at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase in debt during 2009 reflects $800.0 million of public bonds issued in July 2009 in anticipation of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition, offset by a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding. Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. Net Cash Flow from Operations Net cash provided by operations was $368.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $475.8 million in 2009 and $293.6 million in 2008. Changes in working capital had a significant impact on cash provided by operations during the years presented. Lower raw material costs during 2009 reduced overall working capital needs compared to 2008, while increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during 2010. Net cash provided by operations was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $15.0 million, $30.0 million, and $2.3 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Required contributions for our U.S. pension plans are expected to be less than $5.0 million in 2011. Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $158.8 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. Under the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we have the capacity to borrow up to $625 million. This facility is principally used as back up for our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreement includes a $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, a total of $4.0 million of multicurrency loans were outstanding on the revolving credit facility. If this revolving credit facility were no longer available to us, we would expect to 14 Table of Contents meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate. Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010, has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis. The related back up revolving credit agreement expires on April 28, 2013. Liquidity Outlook On December 31, 2010, our revolving credit facility supported total commercial paper outstanding of $158.8 million, industrial revenue bonds outstanding of $8.0 million, and multicurrency loans outstanding of $4.0 million. As a result, we had the capacity to borrow an additional $454.2 million under the credit facility as of December 31, 2010. Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. In addition, increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $113.2 million during 2010, compared to $89.2 million in 2009, and $120.5 million in 2008. Over the next several years, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be less than total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities. Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2.2 percent during the first quarter of 2010 to 23 cents per share from 22.5 cents per share. This follows increases of 2.3 percent in 2009 and 4.8 percent in 2008. In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved the 28th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 24 cents per share, a 4.3 percent increase. Share Repurchases During 2010, we purchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock in the open market. Due to the ongoing negotiation of the Food Americas acquisition, no shares were repurchased during 2009. During 2008, we purchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market. As of December 31, 2010, we were authorized to purchase up to 9.5 million additional shares of our common stock for the treasury. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2010. Capital leases are insignificant. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long term debt obligations (1) $ 1,288.0 $ 2.9 $ 484.9 400.2 $ 400.0 Interest expense (2) 355.1 66.7 112.3 78.2 97.9 Operating leases (3) 40.1 8.9 12.6 7.7 10.9 Purchase obligations (4) 298.5 296.9 0.8 0.8 Postretirement obligations (5) 60.2 2.5 26.6 14.2 16.9 Total $ 2,041.9 $ 377.9 $ 637.2 $ 500.3 $ 526.5 Pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on April 28, 2013. (2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December 31, 2010. (3) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (5) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations. 15 Table of Contents Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. A portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $170.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by $1.7 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $12.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. Amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were $1.3 million income and $4.0 million income in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our business in Brazil holds U.S. dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $86.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long term asset or liability and as an expense element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses. Amounts recognized in income related to these currency swaps were $6.9 million expense and $7.9 million expense in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $62.1 million in 2010 and a decrease of $125.8 million in 2009. Operating profit increased by approximately $5.8 million in 2010 and decreased by $9.4 million in 2009 as a result of foreign currency translation. Shareholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2010 was an increase in shareholders equity totaling $23.0 million. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Pension costs Amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Net periodic pension cost recorded in 2010 was $26.5 million, compared to pension cost of $18.8 million in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets. For the year 2010, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 70 percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. For the historical long term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December 31, 2010, our pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of 2.0 percent, 7.3 percent, 8.5 percent, and 8.7 percent, respectively. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our 16 Table of Contents outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and, based on their results, we have determined our assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2010, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.25 percent, a decrease of one half of one percent from the 5.75 percent rate used at December 31, 2009. For our non U.S. pension plans, we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country. Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.25 percent for the discount rate and 8.25 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2011 to be in a range of $33 million to $37 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2011 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) to pension expense (dollars in millions) from current assumptions Discount rate 4.50 percent $ 5.3 4.75 percent 3.4 5.00 percent 1.7 5.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 5.50 percent (1.6 ) 5.75 percent (3.1 ) 6.00 percent (4.7 ) Rate of Return on Plan Assets 7.50 percent $ 3.3 7.75 percent 2.2 8.00 percent 1.1 8.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 8.50 percent (1.1 ) 8.75 percent (2.3 ) 9.00 percent (3.3 ) The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate. Total increase (decrease) in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (dollars in millions) Income, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 4.50 percent $ (59.6 ) 4.75 percent (38.7 ) 5.00 percent (18.9 ) 5.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 5.50 percent 17.9 5.75 percent 35.0 6.00 percent 51.1 Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2010. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review 17 Table of Contents these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition, and amounts of future cash flows. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Guidance Adopted in the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance requires that information be provided about asset movements among Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, requires expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements. The majority of the guidance was effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 and did not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures A portion of the guidance issued by the FASB in January 2010 referenced above, related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. This portion of the guidance will expand the Companys disclosures and will not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on informati on available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs and availability, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; changes in the availability of financing; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt lev els; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of an enterprise resource system; costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations; unexpected costs associated with acquisitions or divestitures; changes in governmental regulations, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 1 0 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position and liquidity. The effect on our consolidated results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
