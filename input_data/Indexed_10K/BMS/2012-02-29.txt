ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis Three Years Ended December 31, 2011 Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Three year review of results (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 5,322.7 100.0 % $ 4,835.0 100.0 % $ 3,514.6 100.0 % Cost of products sold 4,412.5 83.0 3,941.8 81.5 2,814.4 80.1 Gross margin 910.2 17.0 893.2 18.5 700.2 19.9 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 483.4 9.1 459.1 9.5 370.9 10.5 Research and development 38.7 0.7 34.3 0.7 24.3 0.7 Facility consolidation and other costs 38.4 0.7 Other operating (income) expense, net (17.7 ) (0.3 ) (1.0 ) 24.7 0.7 Operating income 367.4 6.8 400.8 8.3 280.3 8.0 Interest expense 76.8 1.4 73.5 1.5 42.1 1.2 Other non operating (income) expense, net (1.6 ) (2.1 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes 292.2 5.4 327.3 6.8 240.3 6.8 Provision for income taxes 104.9 1.9 117.6 2.4 87.8 2.5 Income from continuing operations 187.3 3.5 209.7 4.4 152.5 4.3 Income from discontinued operations 1.8 Net Income 187.3 3.5 211.5 4.4 152.5 4.3 Less: net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests 3.2 0.1 6.4 0.2 5.3 0.1 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. $ 184.1 3.4 $ 205.1 4.2 % $ 147.2 4.2 % Effective income tax rate 35.9 % 35.9 % 36.5 % Overview Bemis Company, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Generally about 65 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 90 percent of our net sales. Our remaining net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets. Market Conditions The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our leading flexible packaging market positions in North and South America reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added, proprietary products. We also manufacture products for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins, films, paper, ink, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals. During the first five months of 2011, the cost of our commodity and specialty resin raw materials increased substantially. Furthermore, the time lag between raw material cost increases and the subsequent adjustment of our selling prices in accordance with formulas included in our customer pricing agreements has had a negative effect on operating profit during 2011 compared to 2010. Weak global economic conditions, sustained high unemployment levels, and higher retail food prices in grocery stores has also led to reduced consumer demand for certain packaged food products during 2011. Lower unit sales volumes during the second half of 2011 reflect the lower unit sales volumes experienced by many of our customers. Facility Consolidation During the fourth quarter of 2011, Bemis initiated a facility consolidation program to improve efficiencies and reduce fixed costs. As a part of this program, both administrative and production workforce levels were reduced during the fourth quarter. Bemis has also announced the planned closure of five facilities, two of which were completed by early January 2012. Most of the production from these five facilities will be transferred to other Bemis facilities. Charges associated with the facility consolidation related activities totaled $38.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, including $26.3 million of employee related costs and $12.1 million of fixed asset accelerated depreciation and writedowns. Management expects to recognize additional pre tax charges related to these efforts of approximately $45 million over the next 15 months, primarily associated with accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation, and lease termination expenses. Cash payments in 2012 are expected to be approximately $35 million. Acquisitions Shield Pack On December 1, 2011, we acquired the common stock of Shield Pack, LLC of West Monroe, Louisiana for a cash purchase price of approximately $44.5 million, subject to customary post closing adjustments. Shield Pack is a manufacturer of high barrier liners for bulk container packaging. 11 Table of Contents Mayor Packaging On August 1, 2011, we acquired Mayor Packaging, a Hong Kong based manufacturer of consumer and specialty flexible packaging including a manufacturing facility in Dongguan, China. The cash purchase price of approximately $96.7 million was financed with commercial paper. Noncontrolling Interest of Dixie Toga Ltda. (formerly Dixie Toga, S.A.) During the third quarter of 2011, we completed the purchase of the remaining shares owned by the noncontrolling interest of our Brazilian subsidiary, Dixie Toga Ltda., for approximately $90 million. Alcan Packaging Food Americas On March 1, 2010, we acquired the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging (Alcan Packaging Food Americas), a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, we acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales of $1.4 billion. These facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment our product offerings and technological capabilities. The majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of 2009 through the issuance of $800.0 million of public notes and 8.2 million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market at the time of closing. Sale of Discontinued Operations Under the terms of an order signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 25, 2010, a portion of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business acquired on March 1, 2010 was to be divested; accordingly, we had classified the related operating results as discontinued operations. On July 13, 2010, we sold these discontinued operations to Exopack Holding Corp., an affiliate of private investment firm Sun Capital Partners, Inc. The transaction was completed for a cash purchase price, net of selling costs, of $75.2 million. The divested business recorded 2009 net sales of approximately $156 million and included two facilities which manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat. Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 5,322.7 $ 4,835.0 $ 3,514.6 Net income attributable to Bemis Company, Inc. 184.1 205.1 147.2 Diluted earnings per share 1.73 1.85 1.38 2011 versus 2010 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 10.1 percent. We estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 4.8 percent during the year. Currency translation increased net sales by 1.7 percent. The remaining organic sales growth primarily reflects higher selling prices which were partially offset by lower unit sales volume. Higher selling prices during 2011 reflect higher raw material costs. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 of $1.73 included charges of $0.24 for facility consolidation and other costs and $0.05 related to our Mayor Packaging acquisition, partially offset by a $0.03 gain associated with a non U.S. pension plan curtailment. This compared to diluted earnings per share for 2010 of $1.85, which included a $0.23 charge related to our Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition and a $0.06 charge related to the pre closing impact of the July 2009 financing of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.02 in 2010. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and lower unit sales volumes during the year. 2010 versus 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 37.6 percent. Acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 31 percent during the year. The effect of currency translations accounted for a 1.8 percent increase in net sales. Net of these impacts, the increase in net sales primarily reflects higher prices and improved unit sales volume from both existing and acquired operations. Selling prices were increased during 2010 in response to higher raw material costs. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 of $1.85 included a $0.09 charge for transaction related legal, accounting and other professional fees, a $0.09 charge associated with Alcan Packaging Food Americas purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog, as well as a $0.05 charge for acquisition related integration costs including severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs. In addition, the pre closing impact of the July 2009 financing of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition reduced 2010 diluted earnings by $0.06 per share. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.02 in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share of $1.38 included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, an administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offset by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 improved compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 due to increased unit sales volume, currency translation benefits, and the accretive effect of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including applications for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack foods, frozen foods, lawn and garden products, health and hygiene products, beverages, healthcare products, bakery goods, and dry foods. 12 Table of Contents (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 4,747.9 $ 4,272.4 $ 2,983.4 Operating profit (See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 427.6 468.5 379.2 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 9.0 % 11.0 % 12.7 % 2011 versus 2010 For the total year 2011, flexible packaging net sales increased 11.1 percent compared to 2010. Acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 5.4 percent, and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of 1.6 percent. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher selling prices partially offset by the impact of lower unit sales volumes of packaging for applications such as bakery, confectionery, pet food, and health and hygiene products. Operating profit for the total year 2011 was $427.6 million, or 9.0 percent of net sales, compared to $468.5 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, in 2010. The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in 2011 by $5.0 million. The lower percentage of operating profit to net sales in 2011 reflects the impact of higher raw material costs during the first six months of 2011 and lower unit sales volumes during the second half of the year. In addition, operating profit for 2011 included $34.9 million of facility consolidation and other charges and $4.5 million of Mayor Packaging acquisition related charges, which was partially offset by a $2.7 million gain associated with a non U.S. pension plan curtailment. Total year 2010 operating profit included $20.1 million of Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition related charges. 2010 versus 2009 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 43.2 percent in 2010. Acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 36 percent, and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of 2.4 percent. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher sales across many market categories. Operating profit increased to $468.5 million, or 11.0 percent of net sales, in 2010, compared to $379.2 million, or 12.7 percent of net sales in 2009. The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in 2010 by $6.5 million compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 reflects the combined impact of generally lower operating margins from the acquired business and the short term negative impact of higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments. In addition, operating profit includes $20.1 million of acquisition related charges. Operating margins in 2009 benefited from decreasing raw material costs during the first half of that year. Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the medical, automotive, construction and electronics industries. Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 574.8 $ 562.6 $ 531.2 Operating profit (See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 33.4 33.0 13.6 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 5.8 % 5.9 % 2.6 % 2011 versus 2010 For the total year 2011, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $574.8 million, a 2.2 percent increase from net sales in 2010. Currency effects increased net sales by 2.4 percent. Net sales reflected lower unit sales volumes offset by higher selling prices. Operating profit was $33.4 million or 5.8 percent of net sales in 2011, compared to $33.0 million or 5.9 percent of net sales in 2010. The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in 2011 by $1.1 million. Lower unit sales volumes reflecting current weak economic conditions were offset by higher selling prices across all product categories. Total year 2011 operating profit included a $2.7 million charge related to facility consolidation and other costs. 2010 versus 2009 For the total year 2010, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $562.6 million, a 5.9 percent increase from net sales in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 1.6 percent. The resulting 7.5 percent increase in net sales reflects the increase in unit sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 when economic conditions negatively impacted demand for our pressure sensitive materials products. The net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit by $0.7 million in 2010. Higher operating profit in 2010 reflects the positive impact of substantially improved unit sales volumes combined with disciplined cost management. Consolidated Gross Profit (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross profit $ 910.2 $ 893.2 $ 700.2 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 17.0 % 18.5 % 19.9 % Gross profit in 2011 reflects the negative impact of increasing resin prices during the first half of the year coupled with lower sales volume during the second half of 2011. Gross profit in 2010 reflects the negative impact of $15.4 million of expenses associated with the purchase accounting impact of the fair value write up of inventory and a charge for the fair value of the customer order backlog, 13 Table of Contents both related to the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 is primarily attributable to generally lower operating margins in the newly acquired Alcan Packaging Food Americas business combined with increasing raw material costs. Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 483.4 $ 459.1 $ 370.9 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 9.1 % 9.5 % 10.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in both 2011 and 2010 primarily reflecting the increased costs associated with the August 1, 2011 purchase of Mayor Packaging, and the March 1, 2010 purchase of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2010 included $4.5 million of expenses primarily related to severance and equipment relocation costs associated with our Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. Research and Development (R&D) (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Research and development (R&D) $ 38.7 $ 34.3 $ 24.3 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Other operating (income) expense, net (17.7 ) (1.0 ) 24.7 For the year 2011, other operating income and expense included $20.0 million of fiscal incentive income compared to $15.9 million in 2010 and $16.6 million in 2009. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit. Other operating income and expense for the year 2011 also included $3.1 million of acquisition related expense, compared to $15.6 million of such charges in 2010. During 2009, in addition to the fiscal incentive income, other operating income and expense included $44.8 million of acquisition related expenses. Interest Expense (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense 76.8 73.5 42.1 Effective interest rate 5.4 % 5.8 % 4.3 % Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the October 2011 issuance of $400 million long term notes. These funds were raised in anticipation of the repayment of our $300 million notes which will mature on April 1, 2012. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the July 2009 issuance of $800 million of long term notes as financing for the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. Other Non operating (Income) Expense, Net (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Other non operating (income) expense, net (1.6 ) (2.1 ) During 2011, net other non operating (income) expense included interest income and a gain on sales of excess land, partially offset by a foreign exchange loss of $1.8 million. During 2010, net other non operating income included interest income offset by foreign exchange losses. Income Taxes (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Income taxes 104.9 117.6 87.8 Effective tax rate 35.9 % 35.9 % 36.5 % The difference between our overall tax rate of 35.9 percent in 2011 and 2010, and 36.5 percent in 2009 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits and the differences between tax rates in the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga Ltda., our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary. During the third quarter of 2011, we completed the purchase of the outstanding shares owned by the noncontrolling interest of Dixie Toga for approximately $90 million. 14 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt to Total Capitalization Net debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt net of cash balances divided by total debt net of cash balances plus equity) was 48.0 percent at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.9 percent at December 31, 2010. Total debt increased from $1,286.5 million as of December 31, 2010 to $1,569.9 million as of December 31, 2011, principally due to acquisition financing. In addition, equity balances decreased in 2011 reflecting changes in exchange rates used to translate foreign currency financial statements to the U.S. dollar. Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. Cash Flow Net cash provided by operations totaled $420.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $368.0 million in 2010 and $475.8 million in 2009. Increases in working capital had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during the years presented. Increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during 2011 and 2010. Net cash provided by operations was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $15.0 million, $15.0 million, and $30.0 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $65 million in 2012. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $284.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, including the acquisition of both Shield Pack and Mayor Packaging. This compares to cash used in investing activities in 2010 totaling $1.2 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas. During 2009, we invested $30.3 million net cash in the acquisition of the South American rigid packaging operations of Huhtamaki Oyi. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 included common stock dividend payments of $101.8 million, the purchase of 5 million shares of our common stock for $161.1 million, and the purchase of the remaining shares of our Brazilian subsidiary, Dixie Toga, Ltda. owned by the noncontrolling interest for $89.7 million. This compares to cash used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 that included common stock dividends of $101.9 million, the purchase of 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $45.8 million, and the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests of $15.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 reflected the issuance of $800 million of public notes and 8.2 million of common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The proceeds of these financing activities were used to fund the 2010 purchase of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition. Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs. At year end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $46.5 million. Based on our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. Under the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we have the capacity to borrow up to $800 million. This facility is principally used as back up for our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreement includes a $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011, there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. If this revolving credit facility was no longer available to us and we were not able to issue commercial paper, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate. Public notes totaling $300 million are scheduled to mature in April 2012 and industrial revenue bonds totaling $8 million are scheduled to mature in November 2012. These bonds have been classified as long term debt on the December 31, 2011 balance sheet in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance them with commercial paper. Liquidity Outlook On July 21, 2011, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the total amount available from $625 million to $800 million and to extend the term from April 29, 2013 to July 21, 2016. As of December 31, 2011, $54.5 million of outstanding debt was supported by this credit facility, leaving $745.5 million of available credit. As of December 31, 2011 cash and cash equivalents outside of the United States was $36.9 million. Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. In addition, increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $135.2 million during 2011, compared to $113.2 million in 2010, and $89.2 million in 2009. Over the next several years, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be less than total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities. 15 Table of Contents Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4.3 percent during the first quarter of 2011 to $0.24 per share from $0.23 per share. This follows increases of 2.2 percent in 2010 and 2.3 percent in 2009. In February 2012, the Board of Directors approved the 29th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.25 per share, a 4.2 percent increase. Share Repurchases During 2011, we purchased 5.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market, compared to 1.5 million shares in 2010. No shares were repurchased during 2009. As of December 31, 2011, we were authorized to purchase an additional 4.5 million shares of our common stock for the treasury. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2011. Obligations under capital leases are insignificant. Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long term debt obligations (1) $ 1,568.2 $ 321.4 $ 447.0 $ $ 799.8 Interest expense (2) 441.0 73.2 125.9 90.0 151.9 Operating leases (3) 71.5 11.5 16.2 10.4 33.4 Purchase obligations (4) 248.6 237.2 2.2 0.3 8.9 Postretirement obligations (5) 73.4 30.5 13.0 11.5 18.4 Severance (6) 15.8 15.8 Total $ 2,418.5 $ 689.6 $ 604.3 $ 112.2 $ 1,012.4 (1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on July 21, 2016. Certain amounts have been reflected as being due in less than one year even though they have been classified as long term in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These items include $300 million notes, $8 million IRB, and commercial paper and have been included in Long Term Debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance these items on a long term basis. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our long term debt. (2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that future variable interest rates are equal to rates at December 31, 2011. (3) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. (4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services. (5) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations. (6) Severance costs relate to our facility consolidation program, which is further described in Note 2 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance, we have accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates. A portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates. As such, increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $455.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding (which includes $400 million fixed rate notes that have been effectively converted to variable rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable rate interest rate swap) would increase by $4.6 million. Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $9.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative 16 Table of Contents instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. Amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were $0.5 million income and $1.3 million income in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our business in Brazil held U.S. dollar denominated debt which created exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we entered into currency swap contracts with maturities that matched the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We had not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. There were no outstanding currency swap contracts as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $86.4 million. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to swap contracts was recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long term asset or liability and as an expense element of other non operating (income) expense, net, which offset the related transaction gains or losses. Amounts recognized in income related to these currency swaps were $6.6 million expense and $12.0 million expense in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to economically convert a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $400 million. These contracts were designated as hedges of the Companys $400 million 4.50 percent fixed rate debt due in 2021. The variable rate for each of the interest rate swaps is based on the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), set in arrears, plus a fixed spread. The variable rates are reset semi annually at each net settlement date. The net settlement benefit to the Company, which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense, was $1.6 million in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of these interest rate swaps was $3.3 million, in the Companys favor, using discounted cash flow or other appropriate methodologies, and is included in deferred charges and other assets with a corresponding increase in long term debt. The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $80.3 million and $62.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Operating profit increased by approximately $6.1 million and $5.8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of foreign currency translation. Shareholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2011 was a decrease in shareholders equity totaling $112.9 million. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill. Pension costs Amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Net periodic pension cost recorded in 2011 was $28.6 million, compared to pension cost of $26.5 million in 2010 and $18.8 million in 2009. One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets. For the year 2011, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 70 percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on total U.S. pension plan assets of 8.25 percent. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based on our target asset allocation. For the historical long term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December 31, 2011, our U.S. pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of 3.7 percent, 6.4 percent, 7.4 percent, and 8.2 percent, respectively. Using our U.S. target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and, based on their results, we have determined our U.S. asset return assumptions to be reasonable. This assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense. 17 Table of Contents At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2011, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 4.25 percent, a decrease of one percent from the 5.25 percent rate used at December 31, 2010. For our non U.S. pension plans, we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country. U.S. Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based on our current discount rate assumption of 4.25 percent and our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 8.00 percent, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2012 to be in a range of $45 million to $50 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2012 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets. Total increase (decrease) to pension expense (dollars in millions) from current assumptions Discount rate 3.25 percent $ 8.2 3.50 percent 6.0 3.75 percent 3.9 4.00 percent 1.9 4.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 4.50 percent (1.9 ) 4.75 percent (3.7 ) 5.00 percent (5.4 ) 5.25 percent (7.0 ) Rate of Return on Plan Assets 7.00 percent 4.9 7.25 percent 3.6 7.50 percent 2.4 7.75 percent 1.2 8.00 percent Current Assumption 0.0 8.25 percent (1.2 ) 8.50 percent (2.4 ) 8.75 percent (3.6 ) 9.00 percent (4.9 ) The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an asset, in the case of an overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate. Total increase (decrease) in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (dollars in millions) Income, net of taxes, from current assumptions Discount rate 3.25 percent $ (101.9 ) 3.50 percent (74.3 ) 3.75 percent (48.3 ) 4.00 percent (23.5 ) 4.25 percent Current Assumption 0.0 4.50 percent 22.4 4.75 percent 43.7 5.00 percent 63.9 5.25 percent 83.2 Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2011. Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition, and amounts of future cash flows. 18 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements There has been no new accounting guidance issued or effective during 2011 that is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Forward looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; customer contract bidding activity; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs, availability, and terms, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; unexpected energy surcharges; broad changes in customer order patterns; our ability to achieve expected cost savings associated with facility consolidation initiatives; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; a failure in our information technology infrastructure or applications; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, fiscal incentives, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future administrative and litigation proceedings; unexpected outcomes in our current and future tax proceedings; changes in domestic and international tax laws; costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations; unexpected costs associated with the integration of acquired businesses; unexpected costs related to plant closings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statement. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position and liquidity. The effect on our consolidated results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items. 19 Table of Contents
