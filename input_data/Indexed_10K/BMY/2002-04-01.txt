Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Summary The year 2001 was one of change for Bristol Myers Squibb. Consistent with the strategy to become a more focused pharmaceutical Company, a number of transactions were completed during the year, including the divestiture of two nonpharmaceutical businesses: Clairol (beauty care) and Zimmer (orthopaedics). The results for these businesses have been reported as discontinued operations and excluded from consolidated sales and expenses for all years. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business (DuPont) and made a 19.9% equity investment in a biotechnology company ImClone Systems, Inc. (ImClone). Including sales by DuPont, Bristol Myers Squibb reported $19.4 billion in annual global sales for 2001, an increase of 7% (9% excluding foreign exchange) over 2000. Domestic sales, representing 68% of worldwide sales, increased 9% to $13.1 billion, while international sales increased 3% (8% excluding foreign exchange) to $6.3 billion. Sales for the Company, excluding sales by DuPont, were $19.1 billion, an increase of 5% (7% excluding foreign exchange) over 2000. The Companys most important product lines made a significant contribution to the Companys sales growth. Many of these experienced double digit growth on a worldwide basis. During the year, the Company had four blockbuster products, each with annual sales in excess of $1 billion PRAVACHOL*, GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX and TAXOL* (paclitaxel). In fact, PRAVACHOL* and GLUCOPHAGE each had annual sales in excess of $2 billion. The Company had 50 product lines with more than $50 million in annual sales, including 28 with more than $100 million in annual sales and four with more than $500 million in annual sales. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 11% to $6.4 billion from $5.8 billion in 2000 on a stand alone basis, which excludes the effects of the DuPont and ImClone transactions and nonrecurring items. On this basis, net earnings increased 10% to $4.7 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $2.44 and 12% to $2.41, respectively. Net earnings for the total Company (continuing and discontinued operations) increased 11% to $5.2 billion in 2001. On this same basis, basic and diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $2.70 and $2.67, respectively. Bristol Myers Squibbs financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2001, the Company held almost $5.7 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable securities. Cash provided from operating activities reached $5.4 billion in 2001. In connection with the DuPont and ImClone transactions, the Company issued $5.0 billion of notes of which $2.5 billion matures in 2006 and $2.5 billion matures in 2011 with coupon interest rates of 4.75% and 5.75%, respectively. Returns to shareholders included dividend distributions of $2.1 billion and stock repurchases of $1.6 billion. Dividends per common share were $1.10 in 2001, increasing from $0.98 per share paid in 2000. In December 2001, the Company announced a dividend increase, the 30th consecutive year that dividends have increased. The 2002 indicated annual payment is $1.12 per common share, a 2% increase over 2001. As further evidence of its strong financial position, Bristol Myers Squibb is one of only seven U.S. industrial companies to receive a AAA credit rating from both Moodys and Standard & Poors investment rating agencies. In 2001, consistent with our mission to extend and enhance human life, by developing the highest quality products, the Company on a stand alone basis invested $2.1 billion in research and development, a 10% growth over 2000. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 11% over 2000, with a compound annualized growth in spending of 14% over the past five years. That continuing investment led to the discovery of innovative new products and the development of new indications for existing products in 2001 that led to twelve regulatory filings, including VANLEV* for hypertension, ARIPIPRAZOLE for schizophrenia and PLAVIX for acute coronary syndrome. In addition, the Company 14 received seven regulatory approvals for supplemental submissions, including TEQUIN* for short course (five day) regimen. U.S. patents that are expected to expire in the next three years include the composition of matter patents for MONOPRIL* (December 2002) and SERZONE* (March 2003). In addition, a use patent for PARAPLATIN* will expire in April 2004. Hatch Waxman data protection will expire for GLUCOPHAGE XR in October 2003 and GLUCOVANCE in July 2003. All of these expiry dates could be extended by an additional six months under the pediatric extension, upon the completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in advance of the expiration. In October 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business from E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company for $7.8 billion. In 2001, the Company also announced a collaboration agreement with Exelixis, Inc., to create a new generation of cancer drugs that selectively destroy cancers that harbor defects in tumor suppressed gene pathways. In September 2001, the Company entered into a commercial agreement with ImClone to codevelop and copromote an investigational cancer drug, Erbitux. Under the commercial agreement, the Company was required to pay ImClone an aggregate of $1 billion upon the achievement of three milestones, of which $200 million was paid in 2001. In November 2001, the Company also purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone for $70 per share, which represented approximately 19.9% of the ImClone shares outstanding just prior to the commencement of the public tender offer. On December 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA refused to accept for filing the Biologics License Application (BLA) that had been submitted by ImClone for Erbitux. The BLA had been submitted to gain marketing approval to treat irinotecan refractory colorectal carcinoma. On January 18, 2002, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it is investigating questions about the conduct of ImClone in the development of Erbitux. On January 25, 2002, ImClone announced it had received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as inquiries from the Justice Department and the aforementioned subcommittee. The Company will cooperate with these investigations. The Company and ImClone met with the FDA in February 2002 and are currently evaluating next steps. On March 5, 2002, the agreement with ImClone was revised to reduce the total payments to $900 million from $1 billion. Under the new agreement the Company paid ImClone $140 million in the first quarter of 2002 and will pay ImClone $60 million in March 2003 and an aggregate of $500 million upon the achievement of two milestones. Also under the agreement, the Company will pay ImClone a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of product revenues in North America. The carrying value of the Companys approximately 19.9% equity investment in ImClone was $481 million as of December 31, 2001. On a per share basis, the carrying value of the Companys ImClone investment and the closing market value of ImClone shares as of December 31, 2001, were $33.40 and $46.46, respectively. Given the FDAs December 28, 2001, action and the market value of ImClone shares since December 31, 2001 ($19.58 per share as of January 24, 2002), it is possible that the Company could recognize a charge for impairment of the investment in ImClone in future periods based upon further developments of the status of Erbitux and the market value of ImClone. Net Sales Sales increased 7% in 2001 to $19.4 billion, including the sales from the DuPont acquisition. Domestic sales increased 9% in 2001 and 14% in 2000, while international sales increased 3% in 2001 (8% excluding foreign exchange) and decreased 2% in 2000 (a 5% increase excluding foreign exchange). On a stand alone basis, excluding sales from the DuPont acquisition, sales increased 5% in 2001 to $19.1 billion compared with increases of 8% and 12% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The consolidated sales growth in 15 2001, on a stand alone basis, resulted from a 5% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 2000, the 8% increase in sales reflected an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 1999, the 12% increase in sales reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In general, the business of the Company is not seasonal. A significant portion of the Companys domestic pharmaceutical sales is made to wholesalers. As a result, the financial results and quarterly comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of these major wholesalers and the corresponding changes in inventory levels maintained by these wholesalers. These changes may not reflect underlying prescriber demand. While the Company cannot verify wholesaler inventory levels, the Company believes average wholesaler inventories of products in the U.S. increased during 2001 by approximately four weeks of its average sales to these wholesalers primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company to them. As a result, the Company estimates the Companys 2001 domestic pharmaceutical sales included approximately four weeks of additional sales. The Company believes current inventories of its products held by wholesalers in the U.S. significantly exceed levels the Company considers desirable on a going forward basis. The Company is in the process of developing a plan to reduce these wholesaler inventory levels. The Company expects this reduction in wholesaler inventories to lower levels will negatively impact its financial results in future periods. The Company will make further disclosure later in April 2002 about the plans it is developing to reduce wholesaler inventory levels and the Companys expectations with respect to the likely impact on its financial results. In 2001, worldwide pharmaceutical sales, on a stand alone basis, increased 6% (8% excluding foreign exchange), with U.S. pharmaceutical sales up 8% over the prior year. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales include the following: Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol lowering agent and the Companys largest selling product, increased 20% to $2,173 million. Domestic sales increased 21% to $1,366 million, while international sales increased 17% (22% excluding foreign exchange) to $807 million. In December 2001, the FDA approved an 80 milligram version of PRAVACHOL*. GLUCOPHAGE franchise sales increased 42% to $2,682 million. GLUCOPHAGE IR, the leading branded oral medication for treatment of non insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, saw sales increase 18% to $2,049 million. The Company expects sales of GLUCOPHAGE IR will decline significantly because generic metformin became available in the U.S. in January 2002. GLUCOVANCE, a new oral combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release tablets had sales of $330 million and $303 million, respectively, compared with introductory sales in 2000 of $110 million and $50 million, respectively. Sales of PLAVIX, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, increased 50% to $1,350 million, driven in part by the positive results of the CURE study (Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischemic Events), which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2001. Sales of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 34% to $510 million. AVAPRO and PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched from the alliance between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi Synthelabo. Sales of TAXOL*, the Companys leading anticancer agent, decreased 25% to $1,197 million. International sales increased 8% (15% excluding foreign exchange) to $652 million, led by strong sales in Japan and France. Domestic sales decreased 45% to $545 million due to generic competition. Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 2% to $702 million. MONOPRIL*, a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, had increased sales of 4% reaching $458 million. 16 Sales of SERZONE*, a novel treatment for depression, increased 14% to $409 million. Sales of BUSPAR*, an antianxiety agent, decreased 52% to $338 million due to generic competition. Sales of TEQUIN*, a quinolone antibiotic, increased to $320 million from $131 million in 2000. In November 2001, the FDA approved TEQUIN* for short course (five day) regimen in treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Sales of VIDEX*, an antiretroviral agent, increased 28% to $259 million due to increased sales of VIDEX* EC enteric coated beadlets, launched in 2000. Sales from the Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor of anticancer medicines and related products, increased 33% to $1,433 million. Total infant formula sales increased 4% to $1,255 million. Worldwide sales of ENFAMIL*, the Companys largest selling infant formula, increased 6% to $773 million. Sales of ostomy products increased 5% (9% excluding foreign exchange) to $450 million, while sales of wound care products increased 9% (13% excluding foreign exchange) to $252 million. Earnings In 2001, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 11% to $6,442 million from $5,826 million in 2000 on a stand alone basis, which excludes the impact of the DuPont, ImClone and nonrecurring items described below. Net earnings, on this basis, increased 10% to $4,736 million compared with $4,309 million in 2000. Basic earnings per share increased 11% to $2.44 from $2.19 in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $2.41 from $2.16. Net earnings margins increased to 24.8% in 2001 from 23.7% in 2000. In 2000, net earnings excluding the nonrecurring items described below were $4,309 million, a 14% increase over 1999. On this basis, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 15% and 16%, respectively, over 1999, and net earnings margins increased to 23.7% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999. The Company recorded certain nonrecurring items (nonrecurring items) in 2001 and 2000 to earnings from continuing operations. The nonrecurring items included in 2001 were acquired in process research and development charges of $2,744 million before taxes related to the DuPont and ImClone transactions, pretax expenses on the DuPont and ImClone transactions of $246 million (which includes the loss from operations, amortization and interest expenses and other onetime costs), a gain on sales of businesses (three branded pharmaceutical products CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN* and FLORINEF*; the licensing rights to CORGARD* in the U.S.; and its SOLAGE product line) of $315 million before taxes and restructuring and other charges of $781 million before taxes, related primarily to workforce reductions, contract sales force termination, exiting product lines and the downsizing and streamlining of business operations. In 2000, nonrecurring items include the gain on sales of businesses (three pharmaceutical products ESTRACE CREAM*, OVCON 35* and OVCON 50* and its SEA BREEZE* brand in Japan) of $160 million pretax, as well as restructuring charges of $508 million before taxes in connection with workforce reductions and asset write downs related to the consolidation and closure of plants and facilities. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 15.4% in 2001 compared with 25.2% in 2000 and 26.5% in 1999. The decline in the effective income tax rate to 15.4% in 2001 is due to lower pretax income in the U.S. as a result of the write off of acquired in process research and development and other nonrecurring items. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, on a stand alone basis, was 26.5% in 2001 compared with 26.0% in 2000, excluding nonrecurring items, and 26.5% in 1999. The effective income tax rate for 2001, on a stand alone basis, increased as a result of lower production of TAXOL* and BUSPAR* in lower tax jurisdictions. 17 Expenses Total costs and expenses, on a stand alone basis excluding the impact of the DuPont and ImClone transactions and nonrecurring items, as a percentage of sales, improved over the last three years to 66.2% in 2001 compared with 68.0% in 2000 and 69.4% in 1999. Including DuPont, ImClone and nonrecurring items, continuing operations total cost and expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 84.6%. Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.4% in 2001 from 26.1% in 2000 principally due to increased sales of lower margin products from the Oncology Therapeutics Network and from a decline in higher margin TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales. Including DuPont, cost of products sold for continuing operations, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.7%. In 2000, cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, declined to 26.1% compared with 26.9% in 1999 principally due to manufacturing variances. Advertising and promotion expenses decreased 14% from the prior year to $1,433 million in 2001 primarily due to lower spending on TAXOL* and BUSPAR*. In 2000, advertising and promotion expenses increased 8% from 1999 to $1,672 million. As a percentage of sales, 2001 advertising and promotion expenses decreased to 7.4%, while 2000 expenses remained at the 1999 level of 9.2%. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 20.1% in 2001 from 21.2% in 2000 and 22.4% in 1999. This decreasing trend is a result of continued improvement in cost efficiencies. In 2001, the decline is also partially due to a reduction in sales force expenses. The Companys investment in research and development, on a stand alone basis, totaled $2,124 million in 2001, an increase of 10% over 2000, and as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.1% in 2001, compared with 10.6% in 2000 and 10.4% in 1999. This spending level reflects the Companys commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and to the clinical development of new products. In 2001, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 11%, and was 13.5% of pharmaceutical sales compared with 13.0% and 12.6% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Including DuPont and ImClone, research and development expenses increased 17% to $2,259 million, or 11.6% of sales. As described in the notes to the financial statements, in 2001 the Company divested three pharmaceutical products CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN*, and FLORINEF*; the licensing rights to CORGARD* in the U.S.; ESTRACE* tablets; the Apothecon commodity business; and its SOLAGE product line. In 2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products ESTRACE CREAM*, OVCON 35* AND OVCON 50* as well as its SEA BREEZE* brand in Japan. In 1999, the Company completed the sale of Laboratori Guieu, SpA, an Italian based gynecologic, pediatric and dermatologic products business. Also in 1999, the Company acquired CAL C TOSE*, a nutritional milk modifier product in Mexico. Discontinued Operations As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol, which resulted in a pretax gain of $4.2 billion ($2.5 billion after taxes). The gain is included in the net gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Also in 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer Holdings, Inc., in a tax free transaction, resulting in a common stock dividend of $203 million. In 2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix Essentials, Inc. (an affiliate of Clairol), resulting in a pretax gain of $402 million ($240 million after tax). The gain is included in the net gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Also in 2000, the Company recorded restructuring charges to discontinued operations of $34 million before taxes in connection with workforce reductions. Net earnings from discontinued operations, which includes earnings only through the date of divestiture, decreased to $226 million in 2001 from $375 million in 2000 and $378 million in 1999. 18 Geographic Areas Bristol Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in the world. The Companys largest markets are the U.S., France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada. Sales in the U.S. increased 9% in 2001. Products with strong growth included GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX, PRAVACHOL*, TEQUIN* and AVAPRO. TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales declined due to generic competition. In 2000, sales in the U.S. increased 14% primarily due to the growth of GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX, BUSPAR*, PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO. Sales in Europe, Mid East and Africa increased 6% in 2001. Excluding foreign exchange, sales increased 10% as a result of the strong growth of PRAVACHOL* and TAXOL* in France and Italy. In 2000, sales in Europe, Mid East and Africa decreased 9%. Sales increased 3% excluding foreign exchange as a result of the growth of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX in France, Italy and Spain. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CAPOTEN sales due to generic competition. Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 2% in 2001. Excluding foreign exchange, sales in the region increased 3%. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was felt primarily in Brazil. Growth was driven primarily by increased sales in Mexico. In 2000, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 3% (6% excluding foreign exchange) primarily as a result of growth in Canada due to increased sales of AVAPRO and ENFAMIL* and in Mexico, due to the growth of ENFAMIL* and CAL C TOSE*. Sales in the Pacific region decreased 1% in 2001 (an 11% increase excluding foreign exchange). The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was felt primarily in Japan. Products with strong growth included TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN* in Japan and nutritional products in the Philippines, Thailand and China. In 2000, Pacific region sales increased 12% (11% excluding foreign exchange) as a result of increases in BUFFERIN*, TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN*. Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce that risk, the Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments, when available on a cost effective basis, to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. Gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. Foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Companys primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the Japanese yen, euro, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. The table below summarizes the Companys outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2001. The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is estimated by using the Black Scholes model and is based on year end currency rates. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is based on year end forward currency rates. The fair value of option contracts and forward contracts should be viewed 19 in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

These contracts primarily related to option contracts with the right to sell euros, Mexican pesos and Brazilian reals. Other contracts at December 31, 2000, primarily included option contracts with the right to buy Japanese yen for U.S. dollars, which had an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $76 million and $1 million. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 144 addresses accounting models for use in determining the impairment of long lived assets and the appropriate methodology for recording an impairment loss. The initial adoption of this accounting requirement will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside a business combination and the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the new rules, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Application of the nonamortization provisions will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 20 Goodwill associated with the DuPont and ImClone transactions and all future business combinations will not be amortized, but will instead be reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company will adopt the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The critical accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The policies on investments, goodwill, and acquired in process research and development are considered noteworthy because they involve estimates, judgments or significant transactions. Financial Position Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000. Working capital was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2000, resulting from higher accrued liabilities due to the restructuring reserves established in the current year. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities and the conversion of other working capital items are expected to fund the near term operations of the Company. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at December 31, 2001, were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with near term maturities. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 2.0% at December 31, 2001, while interest yields on time deposits and marketable securities averaged 1.7%. Short term borrowings and long term debt at December 31, 2001, are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also include Japanese yen long term debt of $217 million. Internally generated cash provided from operations was $5.4 billion in 2001, $4.7 billion in 2000 and $4.2 billion in 1999. Cash provided from operations continued to be the Companys primary source of funds to finance operating needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment. As part of the Companys ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities, the Company has invested $2.3 billion in capital expansion over the past three years. Cash flow from operations also included product liability payments and pension contributions. Cash provided from operations also was used over the past three years to pay dividends of $5.8 billion, to finance $5.3 billion of the Companys share repurchase program and to fund business acquisitions, including the purchase of patents and trademarks at a cost of $595 million. The Companys share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. During 2001, the Company purchased 27 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.6 billion, bringing the total shares acquired since the programs inception to 367 million shares. During the past three years, the Company has repurchased 89 million shares at a cost of $5.3 billion. Employment levels of 46,000 at December 2001 increased from prior year levels of 44,000 as a result of the DuPont acquisition. Forward Looking Information This annual report on Form 10K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain "forward looking" statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should", "anticipate", "estimate", "may", "will", "project", "intend", "plan", "believe" and other words of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial 21 performance. One can also identify forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, market position and product development, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years.
