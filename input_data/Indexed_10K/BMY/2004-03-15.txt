Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Outlook for 2004 below. In addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity, the Company also holds intellectual property in the form of trademarks, on products such as EXCEDRIN, ENFAMIL, THERAGRAN, KERI and BUFFERIN. Trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product, but are considered to have marketing value. Worldwide, all of the Companys important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Specific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant Company sales: United States A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the United States must file a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the FDA. The type of application filed depends on whether the drug is a chemical (a small molecule) or a biological product (a large molecule). If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical, the company files a NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a Biologics License Application is filed. The type of application filed affects regulatory exclusivity rights. A competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the United States must file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA. In the ANDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA. Medicines approved under an NDA can receive several types of regulatory data protection. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical (also known as a new chemical entity) is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection, during which an ANDA cannot be filed with the FDA. If an innovators patent is challenged, as described below, the generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year of the five year data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in a new formulation or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical trials, receives three years of data protection. Finally, an NDA that is designated as an Orphan Drug, which is a drug that gains an indication for treatment of a condition that occurs only rarely in the United States, can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. During this time period neither NDAs nor ANDAs for the same drug product can be approved for the same orphan use. Because a significant portion of patent life can be lost during the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval, the innovator can extend one patent to compensate the innovator for the lost patent term, at least in part. More specifically, the innovator may identify one patent, which claims the product or its approved method of use, and, depending on a number of factors, may extend the expiration of that patent. There are two limits to these extensions. First, the maximum a patent can be extended is 5 years, and second, the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of NDA approval. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical trials are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. This six month period extends all forms of exclusivity (patent and regulatory) that are listed with the FDA at the time the studies are completed and submitted to the FDA. 17 Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law; however, the FDA is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of biologics, and these laws could change in the near future. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data. Beyond the minimum period of regulatory exclusivity provided by U.S. law, many (but not all) innovative drugs are also covered by patents held by the NDA sponsor. The innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovators listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovators NDA is either invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. The innovator then must choose whether to file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patents. If one or more of the NDA listed patents are successfully challenged, or if the innovator chooses not to sue, the first filer of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180 day period of market exclusivity as against all other generic manufacturers. From time to time ANDAs, including Paragraph IV certifications, are filed with respect to certain of the Companys products. The Company evaluates these ANDAs on a case by case basis and, where warranted, files suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patent rights. Several recent developments in the United States have increased the likelihood of generic challenges to innovators intellectual property, and thus, increased the risk of loss of innovators market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. For a discussion of one such litigation related to patent challenges by generic companies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies PLAVIX* Litigation. This is a reflection of the statutory incentive to challenge patents six months of semi exclusivity in certain situations as described above. Second, new statutory and regulatory provisions in the United States limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. Third, the FDA is actively considering abbreviated regulatory approval processes for drugs that are similar to, but not generic copies of, innovative drugs. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular Company product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity. For more information about new legislation, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints below. European Union In the EU, most innovative pharmaceuticals are entitled to ten years of regulatory data protection if marketing approval is obtained via the centralized procedure. Consequently, regardless of whether or not the innovative medicine is covered by patents, generic copies relying on the innovators data usually cannot be approved for a minimum of ten years after approval. For innovative pharmaceuticals that gain marketing approval using the non centralized mutual recognition procedure, this period is six or ten years depending on the individual EU member state. However, regardless of regulatory exclusivity, competitors may obtain approval of an identical product on the basis of their own safety and efficacy data at any time. For more information regarding the regulation of pharmaceutical products in the EU, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints below. Patents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU. However, in contrast to the United States, patents are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic copies can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant. As in the United States, patents in the EU may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country by country basis. In general, EU law treats chemically synthesized drugs and biologically derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity. Japan In Japan, medicines of new chemical entities are entitled to six years of protection for approved indications and dosage. Patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data protection and patent expirations. As in the United States, patents in Japan may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. In general, Japanese law treats chemically synthesized and biologically derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity. 18 Rest of World In countries outside of the United States, the EU and Japan, there is a wide variety of legal systems with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of pharmaceuticals. Most other developed countries utilize systems similar to either the United States (e.g., Canada) or the EU (e.g., Switzerland). Among less developed countries, some have adopted patent laws and or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some less developed nations have formally adopted laws in order to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments, but have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO obligations is a long process, and there is no assurance of the outcome. Thus, in assessing the likely future market exclusivity of the Companys innovative drugs in less developed countries, the Company takes into account not only formal legal rights but political and other factors as well. Marketing, Distribution and Customers In the Companys Pharmaceuticals segment and in its ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, the Company promotes its products in medical journals and directly to health care providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and government agencies. The Company also markets directly to consumers in the United States through direct to consumer print, radio and television advertising. In addition, the Company sponsors general advertising to educate the public about its innovative medical research. For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints below. Through the Companys sales and marketing organizations, the Company explains the approved uses and advantages of its products to medical professionals. The Company works to gain access to health authority, PBM and MCO formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products) and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of its products. The Company also works with MCOs and PBMs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that benefit patients by improving their medical treatment routines. Marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the particular product, but the Company continues to develop information about its products and provides such information in response to inquiries from doctors and other medical professionals. All drugs must complete clinical trials required by regulatory authorities to show they are safe and effective for treating one or more medical problems. A manufacturer may choose, however, to undertake additional studies, including comparative clinical trials with competitive products, to demonstrate additional advantages of a compound. Those studies can be costly and take years to complete, and the results are uncertain. Balancing these considerations makes it difficult to decide whether and when to undertake such additional studies. But, when they are successful, such studies can have a major impact on approved marketing claims and strategies. The Companys operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each sales organization markets a distinct group of products and is typically based on particular therapeutic areas or physician groups. These sales organizations often focus on selling new products when they are introduced, and marketing to physicians is increasingly targeted at specialists and high value primary care physicians. The Companys prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but the Company also sells directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In 2003, sales to three pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, McKesson Corporation (McKesson), Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) accounted for approximately 15%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales. In 2002, sales to AmerisourceBergen and McKesson each accounted for approximately 14% of the Companys total net sales and sales to Cardinal accounted for 13% of the Companys total net sales. In 2001, sales to AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson each accounted for approximately 14% of the Companys total net sales. Sales to these U.S. wholesalers were concentrated in the Pharmaceuticals segment. Apart from these instances, none of the Companys business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related customers. In April 2002, the Company disclosed a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, and developed and subsequently undertook a plan to workdown in an orderly fashion these wholesaler inventory levels. In 2003, the Company took steps intended to moderate investment buying by U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which can result in sales fluctuations unrelated to consumer demand. In 2003, the Company entered into new inventory management agreements (IMAs) with AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal, McKesson and other wholesalers. The agreements have terms of 2 years, cancelable by either parties after 1 year. The IMAs generally establish limits on inventory levels of BMS pharmaceutical products held by the wholesalers, permit limited buy ins of BMS pharmaceutical products by the wholesalers after price increases, at pre price increase prices and require the wholesalers to provide the Company with data in association with the wholesalers sales and inventory levels of BMS pharmaceutical products. 19 OTN acts as BMSs exclusive sales distributor for BMS oncology products to office based oncologists. OTN believes that its extensive customer base, coupled with its overall competitive pricing and customer service, make it attractive to drug manufacturers that wish to serve the office based oncologist community through a focused distribution channel. OTN provides services to manufacturers that include support for product launch, customer specific marketing programs, data services and rapid market research. In 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with McKesson under which McKesson acts as the exclusive distributor of pharmaceutical products to OTN. Under the terms of the agreement, McKesson provides warehousing, packing, shipping, purchasing and inventory management and administrative support services for BMS products and other pharmaceutical products, which are marketed, promoted and sold by OTN. OTN recognizes revenue under the terms of the McKesson agreement using the consignment model as described in 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in this Item 7 has been revised to reflect the restatement. Summary For 2003, the Company reported annual global sales of $20.9 billion. Sales increased 15% from the prior year level, reflecting volume increases of 9%, net price increases of 2%, and a 4% impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. U.S. sales increased 14%, partly due to the impact on 2002 sales from the workdown of non consignment wholesaler inventory, while international sales increased 18%, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2003, the Company had two product lines with sales of over $2.0 billion each PRAVACHOL and PLAVIX*. PRAVACHOL sales grew 25%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2.8 billion, and PLAVIX* sales grew 31%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2.5 billion. In addition to these two products, the Company had 45 product lines with more than $50 million each in annual sales, including 29 product lines with more than $100 million each in annual sales, of which six had annual sales in excess of $500 million each. Earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 70% to $4,694 million in 2003 from $2,761 million in 2002. Net earnings from continuing operations were $3,106 million, or $1.60 and $1.59 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively, compared to $2,067 million, or $1.07 and $1.06 per share each on a basic and diluted basis in 2002. While the Company expects exclusivity losses and new product mix to challenge its margins, the Company remains committed to investing in its businesses to maximize key growth drivers and to advance its pipeline. Several items affected the comparability of the results between 2003 and 2002, as discussed below under Earnings and Outlook for 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company held almost $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Approximately $5.4 billion of such cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries, which the Company does not expect to repatriate in the foreseeable future. In 2004, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with borrowings from the capital markets, to sufficiently cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures and dividends in the U.S. Repatriation to the United States would require additional tax provisions not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion of this matter, see Critical Accounting Policies Income Taxes below. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Companys results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. For additional discussion of this matter, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Long term debt increased to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to the $1.0 billion of fixed rate notes and $1.2 billion of floating rate convertible debentures issued in August 2003 and October 2003, respectively. The proceeds from these issuances were used to repay short term borrowings and fund the cash needs of the U.S. operations. Cash provided from operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2003, and working capital was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company paid dividends of approximately $2.2 billion, which provided a dividend yield of 4.4% in 2003. In 2003, consistent with the Companys mission to extend and enhance human life by developing the highest quality products, the Company invested $2.3 billion in research and development, a 3% growth over 2002. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products, including milestone payments for in licensing and development programs, was $2.1 billion and as a percentage of Pharmaceutical sales was 14.2% compared to 16.5% in 2002. The compound annualized growth in pharmaceutical research and development spending was 9% over the past five years. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements The Company is restating its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002, and consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows, and comprehensive income and retained earnings for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and its financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2003, including comparable interim periods in 2002 (the 2003 Restatement). The restatement affects periods prior to 2001. The impact of the restatement on such prior periods is reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2001. The restatement is reported in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and will be reported in amendments to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003, and September 30, 2003. The 2003 Restatement (i) corrects certain of the Companys historical accounting policies to conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and (ii) corrects certain errors made in the application of GAAP. 34 In late October 2002, the Company determined that certain of its sales to certain wholesalers for its U.S. pharmaceuticals business should be accounted for under the consignment sales accounting model and, accordingly, determined to restate its sales and earnings for sales to these wholesalers. Following that determination, the Company also determined that it would correct certain of its historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to GAAP and certain known errors made in the application of GAAP that were previously not recorded because in each such case the Company believed the amount of any such error was not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, as part of the restatement process, the Company investigated its accounting practices in certain areas that involve significant judgments and determined to restate additional items with respect to which the Company concluded errors were made in the application of GAAP, including certain revisions of inappropriate accounting. In March 2003, the Company completed the restatement of its financial statements for these items and restated its financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2001, including the corresponding interim periods, and the first and second quarters of 2002, including comparable prior interim periods in 2001 (the 2002 Restatement). After completing the 2002 Restatement, the Company continued to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In connection with this effort, the Company (i) has substantially strengthened the organization and personnel of the senior financial and control functions, (ii) adopted more rigorous policies and procedures with respect to its balance sheet review process, (iii) focused its internal audit function on financial reporting controls, (iv) engaged a consultant to assist in the evaluation and documentation of certain financial reporting and disclosure processes throughout the Company and (v) engaged a consultant to assist in a comprehensive and detailed review of certain of the Companys tax reporting and accounting. In addition, at the request of the Companys Audit Committee, the Companys independent auditors performed more extensive procedures with respect to the Companys interim financial information during 2003 and, based on the auditors assessment of the Companys risk profile, expanded the scope and amount of field work to be performed for certain areas in connection with its audit of the Company for 2003. These actions contributed significantly to the Company identifying additional errors relating to prior periods not reflected in the 2002 Restatement. For a discussion of the individual restatement adjustments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements for Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. In connection with their audits of the 2002 Restatement and the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), identified and communicated to the Company and the Audit Committee two material weaknesses (as defined under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) relating to the Companys accounting and public financial reporting of significant matters and to its initial recording and management review and oversight of certain accounting matters. In addition, at that time, PwC identified and communicated to the Company and its Audit Committee a reportable condition (as defined under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) relating to the Companys internal controls over its financial reporting for income taxes. In 2003, the Company dedicated substantial resources to improving its controls over its accounting and financial disclosure and reporting, and the auditors have not identified material weaknesses in connection with their audit of the 2003 financial statements. In addition, the Company has devoted substantial resources towards remedying the reportable condition in relation to taxes. The Company also retained a consultant to assist in a comprehensive and detailed review of certain aspects of its tax accounting and reporting. The Company examined its financial reporting for taxes in each significant jurisdiction where the Company or one of its subsidiaries was subject to tax. As a result of this review, a number of prior period errors were identified, which are reflected in the 2003 Restatement. In addition, the Company undertook a review to evaluate certain issues that had been raised concerning the manner in which the Company determined its provision for income taxes. The Company has determined that prior to 2000 there were certain inappropriate adjustments to tax contingency reserves made for the improper purpose of recording a provision for income taxes consistent with the Companys projected effective tax rate. In addition, there may have been inappropriate adjustments in 2001 and 2002. The Company has completed a review and has not been able to determine whether or not any of the errors relating to its tax contingency reserves being corrected in the restatement are related to inappropriate accounting. In connection with the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, PwC has advised the Company and its Audit Committee that the reportable condition in the income tax accounting area remains, and the Company expects to complete remediation of this reportable condition by the end of 2004. Throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations, all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis. Net Sales Sales in 2003 were $20.9 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year. The increase in sales in 2003 is driven by volume, which increased over 2002 levels, partly due to the impact on 2002 sales from the workdown of non consignment wholesaler inventory. U.S. sales increased 14% to $12,897 million in 2003 compared to a decrease of 4% to $11,348 million in 2002, while international sales increased 18% to $7,997 million in 2003, including a 10% favorable foreign exchange impact, compared to an increase of 8% to $6,758 million in 2002 (with no significant foreign exchange impact). In general, the Companys business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Business Segments under the Pharmaceuticals section below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Companys primary care pharmaceutical products. Sales in 2002 were 35 $18.1 billion compared with $18.0 billion in 2001, an increase of 1%. Sales in 2002 and 2001 included approximately $1,540 million and $331 million, respectively, of sales related to products acquired as part of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition (DuPont Pharmaceuticals), which was completed on October 1, 2001. Domestic sales in 2002 decreased 4% to $11,348 million, while international sales increased 8% to $6,758 million in 2002 (foreign exchange had no significant impact). The composition of the net increase in sales is as follows: 2003 Restated2002 Volume 9 % 3 % Selling prices, net 2 % (3 %) Foreign exchange 4 % Increase in sales 15 % A significant portion of the Companys U.S. pharmaceuticals sales is made to wholesalers. The Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business over several years, primarily in 2000 and 2001. This buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company to its wholesalers, including discounts, buy ins in anticipation of price increases, and extended payment terms to certain U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers. These were generally offered toward the end of a quarter as an incentive to wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the Companys quarterly sales projections established by the Companys senior management. The timing of the Companys recognition of revenue from its sales to wholesalers differs by wholesaler and by period. Historically, the Company recognized revenue for sales upon shipment of products to its customers. Under GAAP, revenue is recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesalers ordinary course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the wholesalers cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesalers ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and, accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments. Under the situations described above, utilizing the consignment model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Companys cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of discounts, rebates, estimated sales allowances and accruals for returns) when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers, on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. For additional discussion of the Companys revenue recognition policy, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies. In the 2002 Restatement, the Company restated its previously issued financial statements for the period 1999 through the second quarter of 2002 to correct the timing of revenue recognition for certain previously recognized U.S. pharmaceuticals sales to Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal) and McKesson Corporation (McKesson), two of the largest wholesalers for the Companys U.S. pharmaceuticals business, that, based on the application of the criteria above, were recorded in error at the time of shipment and should have been accounted for using the consignment model. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys aggregate cost of the pharmaceutical products held by Cardinal and McKesson that were accounted for using the consignment model (and, accordingly, were reflected as consignment inventory on the Companys consolidated balance sheet) was approximately $4 million and $58 million, respectively, of which approximately $2 million and $1 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to oncology products sold through the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN). The deferred revenue, recorded at gross invoice sales price, related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model was approximately $76 million and $470 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which approximately $64 million and $39 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to OTN. As a result of the restatement for the application of the consignment model, approximately $1,980 million of sales (excluding OTN and net of discounts, rebates and other adjustments) had been reversed from the period 1999 through 2001, of which approximately $321 million and $1,397 million were recognized in 2003 and 2002, respectively, as consigned inventory held by Cardinal and McKesson was worked down. A significant portion of the 2003 workdown was recognized in the first quarter. The corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was an increase of $237 million and $1,095 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales to Cardinal and McKesson represented approximately 66%, 70% and 60% of U.S. Pharmaceuticals net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 36 The Company estimates, based on the data noted above, that the inventory of pharmaceutical products held by the other U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers was in the range of approximately $100 million in excess of or below approximately one month of supply at December 31, 2003. This estimate is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data, as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations. The Company expects to account for certain pharmaceutical sales relating to OTN using the consignment model until its agreement with McKesson expires in 2006. Earnings In 2003, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 70% to $4,694 million from $2,761 million in 2002. The increase was primarily a result of the sales increase and specified charges of $1,207 million recorded in 2002 for litigation settlements, asset impairments and write offs for in process research and development. This increase was partially offset by increased investment in advertising and promotion, and in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Earnings from continuing operations increased 50% in 2003 to $3,106 million from $2,067 million in 2002. In 2003, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 50% each to $1.60 and $1.59, respectively, each from $1.07 and $1.06 in 2002, respectively. In 2002, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 22% to $2,761 million from $2,263 million in 2001. Earnings from continuing operations in 2002 increased 10% to $2,067 million from $1,871 million in 2001. In 2002, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% and 12% to $1.07 and $1.06, respectively, from $.96 and $.95 in 2001, respectively. Net earnings margins for continuing operations increased to 14.9% in 2003 from 11.4% in 2002 and 10.4% in 2001. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded several items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following table. For a discussion of these items, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Alliances and Investments, Note 4. Restructuring and Other Items, Note 5. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 6. Discontinued Operations. 2003 Restated2002 Restated2001 (dollars in millions) Acquired in process research and development $ $ 169 $ 2,772 Litigation charge, net 199 659 77 Asset impairment charge for investment in ImClone 379 Restructuring and other items(1) 195 68 588 Gain on sales of businesses/product lines (30 ) (475 ) 394 1,245 2,962 Income tax benefit on above items (36 ) (472 ) (1,057 ) Settlement of prior year tax matters (261 ) $ 358 $ 512 $ 1,905 (1) Restructuring and other items consist of the following: Year ended December 31, 2003 Cost ofProductsSold R&D Provision for Restructuring & Other Total (dollars in millions) Up front payments for four licensing agreements $ $ 102 $ $102 Accelerated depreciation of assets 53 53 Termination benefits and other exit costs 50 50 Relocation expenses 13 13 Asset impairment charges 14 14 Retention benefits 2 2 Change in estimates (39 ) (39 ) $ 67 $ 102 $ 26 $195 37 Year ended December 31, 2002 Cost ofProductsSold R&D Provision forRestructuring& Other Total (dollars in millions) Termination benefits $ $ $ 71 $ 71 Other exit costs 38 38 Accelerated depreciation of assets 69 69 Asset write down and impairment charges 2 51 53 Change in estimates (17 ) (146 ) (163 ) $ (15 ) $ 69 $ 14 $ 68 Year ended December 31, 2001 Decrease inNet Sales Cost ofProductsSold Provision forRestructuring& Other Total (dollars in millions) Downsized and rationalized operations and facilities $ $ $519 $519 Abandonment of non strategic pharmaceutical product lines 74 74 Change in estimates 58 (63 ) (5 ) $ 74 $ 58 $456 $588 Gross margin percentages were 63.7%, 63.9% and 69.4% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margins were negatively impacted in 2003 due to increased sales of lower margin products in the OTN segment, $53 million in accelerated depreciation charges and a $14 million charge for asset impairment and other restructuring expenses largely offset by increased sales of higher margin products such as PRAVACHOL. The lower gross margin in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally due to the impact of generic competition in the United States for GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL&reg; and BUSPAR, and an adverse change in product mix due to increased sales in the OTN segment. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 25.9% in 2003 compared with 14.2% in 2002 and 9.4% in 2001. The increase in the 2003 effective tax rate over the 2002 effective tax rate is primarily due to the decrease in effective tax rate benefit from operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland, treatment of provisions for certain litigation reserves as non deductible, and an increase in estimates for contingent tax matters in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in the 2002 effective tax rate over the 2001 effective tax rate was primarily due to the decrease in effective tax rate benefit from operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland, and the provision of $205 million of valuation allowances, comprised of $112 million related to certain state and foreign net deferred tax assets, $93 million related to certain state and foreign tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, partially offset by a $261 million net release of tax contingency reserves related primarily to the settlement of prior year tax matters, and the determination by the Company as to the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation, which was resolved in 2003. The Company currently believes that the state net deferred tax assets, state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided, more likely than not, will not be realized in the future. The lower effective income tax rate in 2001 results primarily from lower pre tax income in the United States, due to the write off of acquired in process research and development, as well as proportionately greater tax benefits from income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions such as Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland. Expenses Total costs and expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 77.5% in 2003 compared with 84.8% in 2002 and 87.5% in 2001. Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased over the last three years to 36.3% in 2003 compared with 36.1% in 2002 and 30.6% in 2001, principally due to increased sales of lower margin products from OTN largely offset by increased sales of higher margin products such as PRAVACHOL. In 2003, cost of products sold includes $53 million of accelerated depreciation of assets in manufacturing facilities in North America expected to be closed by the end of 2006 and a $14 million charge for asset impairment and other restructuring expenses. Cost of products sold in 2002 included a $15 million reversal of prior period reserves for inventory write offs related to cancelled actions and in 2001 included $58 million of other restructuring expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 22.3% in 2003 from 22.8% in 2002. In 2003, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 13% to $4,660 million from $4,124 million in 2002 primarily due to increased sales support for ABILIFY* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, higher pension costs, higher charges related to system infrastructure, higher insurance premiums, and unfavorable foreign exchange impact, principally related to the euro. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 22.8% in 2002 from 22.5% in 2001, or 2% to $4,124 million from $4,058 million. This slight increase was mainly due to higher sales force expenses as a result of the addition of the Medical Imaging business, acquired in October 2001. 38 Advertising and promotion expenses increased to $1,416 million in 2003 from $1,143 million in 2002, primarily as a result of promotional support for the ABILIFY* and REYATAZ launches and PLAVIX* in the United States, and additional support for in line products and unfavorable foreign exchange impact in Europe. In 2002, advertising and promotion expenses decreased to $1,143 million from $1,201 million in 2001, primarily as a result of reduced spending on the metformin franchise and VANIQA*, partially offset by ABILIFY* product launch expenses and increased support of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in the United States. As a percentage of sales, 2003 advertising and promotion expenses increased to 6.8% from 6.3% in 2002 and 6.7% in 2001. The Companys investment in research and development totaled $2,279 million in 2003, an increase of 3% over 2002 and an increase from 2002 of 2% over 2001, but as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.9% in 2003 compared with 12.2% in 2002 and 12.0% in 2001. Research and development costs included $102 million of charges related to the up front payments for licensing agreements in 2003 and $69 million of accelerated depreciation on research facilities in 2002. In 2003, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products decreased to 14.2% of Pharmaceuticals sales compared with 16.5% and 15.5% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company is focusing its research and development activities so that it can fully realize the value of its research and development pipeline. The new priorities include rebalancing drug discovery and development to increase support for the Companys full late stage development pipeline and closing unnecessary facilities. They also include devoting greater resources to ensuring successful near term product launches and increasing the Companys efforts on in licensing opportunities. In 2002, the charges related to acquired in process research and development were $169 million, primarily related to milestone payments to ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for ERBITUX*. Of the $200 million milestone payment to ImClone, $160 million was expensed as acquired in process research and development in the first quarter of 2002. The remaining $40 million was recorded as an additional equity investment to eliminate the income statement effect of the portion of the milestone payment for which the Company has an economic claim through its ownership interest in ImClone. The acquired in process research and development charge in 2001 was $2,772 million, including $2,009 million related to the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition and $735 million attributable to the ImClone equity investment. In addition, acquired in process research and development for 2002 and 2001 includes charges of $9 million and $28 million, respectively, for licensing payments related to products not yet approved for marketing. Restructuring programs were implemented to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses and rationalize the Companys manufacturing network, research facilities and administrative functions. Actions under the 2003 restructuring program are expected to be complete by 2006 while actions under the 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs were substantially complete at December 31, 2003. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the future annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $64 million, $150 million and $400 million for the 2003, 2002 and 2001 programs, respectively. For additional information on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Restructuring and Other Items. Litigation charges, net of settlement income, were $199 million in 2003, compared to $659 million in 2002 and $77 million in 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company established reserves for liabilities in the total amount of $250 million, comprised of $150 million in relation to wholesaler inventory issues and certain other accounting matters, and $100 million in relation to pharmaceutical pricing and sales and marketing practices. In addition, the Company recorded charges of $31 million for other litigation matters and recognized income of $82 million. The $82 million income consists primarily of $30 million of income for patent defense cost reimbursement, $27 million in litigation settlement income and $21 million from the settlement of anti trust litigation involving vitamin manufacturers. The 2002 charges of $659 million primarily related to BUSPAR and TAXOL&reg; proposed settlements. For additional information on litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Equity in net income of affiliates for 2003 was $151 million, compared with $80 million and $78 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliates principally related to the Companys joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. In 2003, the increase in equity in net income of affiliates primarily reflects higher net income in the Sanofi joint venture. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Alliances and Investments. Other expenses, net of income were $179 million, $229 million and $98 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other expenses include net interest expense, interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, royalty income, and gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. The decrease in expenses in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to net gains from interest rate swaps. The increase in expenses in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally due to higher interest expenses related to borrowings of $6.5 billion related to the DuPont Pharmaceuticals and ImClone transactions in 2001. 39 Business Segments The Company operates in four reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, OTN, Nutritionals and Other Healthcare. In 2003, OTN, which was previously included in the Pharmaceuticals segment, met the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment as outlined in SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Accordingly, prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current year presentations. The percent of the Companys sales by segment were as follows: % of Total Sales 2003 Restated2002 Restated2001 Pharmaceuticals 71 71 75 Oncology Therapeutics Network 11 10 8 Nutritionals 10 10 10 Other Healthcare 8 9 7 Pharmaceuticals In 2003, worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales increased 16% to $14,925 million, reflecting a 2% price increase, 9% volume increase and a 5% increase in foreign exchange. Domestic sales in 2003 increased 16% to $8,431 million primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX*, the PRAVACHOL franchise, ABILIFY* (total revenue), GLUCOVANCE* and PARAPLATIN and partly due to the impact on 2002 sales from the workdown of non consignment wholesaler inventory, partially offset by decreased sales of GLUCOPHAGE* IR and TAXOL&reg; primarily due to generic competition. REYATAZ was launched in July 2003, with $83 million in domestic sales. International sales in 2003 increased 17% to $6,494 million, including an 11% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL, TAXOL&reg;, PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and Analgesic products in Europe partially offset by price declines principally in Germany and Italy. In 2002, worldwide pharmaceuticals sales decreased 6% to $12,812 million, reflecting a 4% price decline, 2% volume decline, and no foreign exchange impact. Domestic sales declined 14% to $7,273 million, primarily due to generic competition in the United States on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL&reg; and BUSPAR, partially offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* and the addition of products acquired from the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition, which was completed on October 1, 2001. In addition, the decrease in domestic pharmaceutical sales was impacted by the buildup in the prior period of inventory levels at those U.S. wholesalers not accounted for under the consignment model and the subsequent workdown in 2002. Approximately $1,395 million of sales (calculated net of discounts, rebates and other adjustments) recognized in the year ended December 31, 2002 had been reversed from prior years. International sales increased 9% to $5,539 million (with no significant foreign exchange impact) primarily due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL and PLAVIX* in Europe, TAXOL&reg; in Japan and the addition of products acquired from the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales include the following: Total revenue for ABILIFY*, which is primarily domestic alliance revenue for the Companys 65% share of net sales in copromotion countries with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), was $283 million. The schizophrenia agent was introduced in the United States in November 2002 and by December 2003, had achieved more than a 7% weekly new prescription share of the U.S. antipsychotic market. The Company received approval for a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ABILIFY* for maintaining stability in patients with schizophrenia, and has announced that it submitted an sNDA for ABILIFY* for the treatment of acute mania in patients with bipolar disorder to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ABILIFY* is being developed and marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb and its partner Otsuka. Sales of the PRAVACHOL franchise increased 25%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2,827 million in 2003. Domestic sales increased 22% to $1,605 million in 2003, while international sales increased 28%, including a 17% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $1,222 million. Sales for the PRAVACHOL franchise increased 8% to $2,266 million in 2002 from $2,101 million in 2001. A six month exclusivity extension was granted through April 2006. Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, increased 31%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2,467 million in 2003. Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 29%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $757 million in 2003. Sales of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* increased 61% and 20% to $1,890 million and $586 million, respectively, in 2002. Sales of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* were $1,171 million and $487 million in 2001. PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* are cardiovascular products that were launched from the alliance between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. 40 Sales of TAXOL&reg; and PARAPLATIN, the Companys leading anticancer agents, increased 9%, including a 12% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $934 million and 24% to $905 million (with no significant foreign exchange impact), respectively, in 2003. International sales of TAXOL&reg; increased 23%, including a 14% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $882 million, led by strong sales in Japan and France. Domestic sales of TAXOL&reg; decreased 62% to $52 million due to generic competition. Domestic sales of PARAPLATIN increased 26% to $769 million. In 2002, TAXOL&reg; sales decreased 23% to $857 million from $1,112 million in 2001 and PARAPLATIN sales increased 23% to $727 million from $592 million in 2001. Sales of SUSTIVA, an antiretroviral agent for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus/auto immune immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS), increased 20%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $544 million in 2003 from $455 million in the prior year. International sales of SUSTIVA increased 31%, including an 18% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $210 million in 2003. SUSTIVA was acquired from DuPont Pharmaceuticals in October 2001 and recorded sales were $68 million for that year. MONOPRIL, a second generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension, had increased sales of 10%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, reaching $470 million in 2003. MONOPRIL sales increased 3% to $426 million in 2002 from $413 million in 2001. GLUCOPHAGE* franchise sales increased 22% to $948 million in 2003, compared to a 67% decrease to $778 million in 2002 from $2,337 million in 2001. GLUCOPHAGE* IR, an oral medication for treatment of non insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, saw 2003 sales decrease 46% to $118 million. The decline in GLUCOPHAGE* IR was due to the introduction of generic metformin in the United States in early 2002. GLUCOPHAGE* IR sales decreased 88% to $220 million in 2002 from $1,838 million in 2001. GLUCOVANCE*, an oral combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE* XR (Extended Release) tablets had sales in 2003 of $424 million and $395 million, respectively, compared with sales in 2002 of $246 million and $297 million, respectively, and sales in 2001 of $269 million and $230 million, respectively. Sales of ZERIT, an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, decreased 20%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $354 million in 2003, primarily as a result of decreased demand due to potential adverse side effects. ZERIT sales decreased 14% to $443 million in 2002 from $515 million in 2001. Sales of VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, increased 2%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $267 million in 2003. VIDEX/VIDEX EC sales increased 9% to $262 million in 2002 from $240 million in 2001. Sales of SERZONE, a treatment for depression, decreased 56% to $98 million in 2003 as a result of loss of exclusivity and a labeling change indicating a potential serious side effect of the product. SERZONE sales decreased 34% to $221 million in 2002 from $334 million in 2001. 41 The following table sets forth a comparison of reported net sales changes and the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Companys U.S. pharmaceutical prescription products. The estimated prescription growth amounts are based on third party data provided by IMS Health, a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry. A significant portion of the Companys domestic pharmaceutical sales is made to wholesalers. Where changes in reported net sales differ from prescription growth, this change in net sales may not reflect underlying prescriber demand. 2003 2002 2001 % Change in U.S. Net Sales(a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions(b) Restated % Change in U.S. Net Sales(a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions(b) Restated % Change in U.S. Net Sales(a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions(b) PRAVACHOL 22 2 1 5 20 9 PLAVIX* 27 29 63 35 28 35 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 24 15 16 13 33 20 SUSTIVA 13 17 * * 16 N/A MONOPRIL 16 (16 ) 2 (8 ) 3 (1 ) GLUCOVANCE* 72 3 (9 ) 48 * * * * GLUCOPHAGE*XR 33 (3 ) 29 81 * * * * ZERIT (29 ) (25 ) (13 ) (11 ) (12 ) (8 ) CEFZIL 14 (4 ) (7 ) (14 ) (9 ) (11 ) COUMADIN 1 (15 ) * * (16 ) N/A VIDEX/VIDEX EC (11 ) 3 15 13 22 13 ** In excess of 200%.

Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $4,369 million in 2003 increased from $3,185 million in 2002 primarily due to increased sales, which were partially offset by increased advertising and product spending on new and existing in line products. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2002 and 2001 were $3,185 million and $1,857 million, respectively. The increase in 2002 is mainly due to lower earnings in 2001 as a result of the write off of $2,772 million of acquired in process research and development. Earnings in 2002 were unfavorably affected by higher sales of lower margin products, and the full year impact of generic competition on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL&reg; and BUSPAR in the United States. Oncology Therapeutics Network In 2003, OTN sales were $2,241 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year due to volume growth and manufacturers price changes. In 2002, sales increased 33% to $1,900 million from $1,433 million in 2001. OTN sales accounted for 11%, 10%, and 8% of the Companys net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $14 million in 2003 decreased slightly from $15 million in 2002 and $16 million in 2001 due to margin erosion and investments in system infrastructure. Nutritionals In 2003, Nutritionals sales were $2,023 million, an increase of 11% over 2002. This increase was due to a 7% increase in volume and a 5% price increase, partially offset by a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange. International sales increased 9%, including a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $938 million from $862 million in 2002. Domestic sales increased 13% to $1,085 million from $959 million in 2002. Worldwide childrens nutritionals sales increased 10%, including a 5% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $421 million in 2003 from $383 million in 2002, as a result of a 29% increase in sales of ENFAGROW, primarily throughout the Pacific region, to $156 million in 2003. Worldwide infant formula sales increased 10% to $1,284 million in 2003 (with no significant foreign exchange impact), primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL, the Companys largest selling infant formula. International sales of ENFAMIL increased 5% to $239 million in 2003 from $228 million in 2002 (with no significant foreign exchange impact) and domestic sales of ENFAMIL increased 10% to $569 million in 2003 from $518 million in 2002. Mead Johnson Nutritionals (Mead Johnson) continues to be the leader in the U.S. infant formula market. In 2002, Nutritionals sales remained consistent with 2001 sales at $1.8 billion, reflecting a 2% increase due to price, offset by a 1% decrease due to volume and a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange. Worldwide infant formula sales decreased 4% to $1,172 million, primarily in the specialty infant formula business. In 2002, worldwide sales of ENFAMIL decreased 1% to $746 million from $753 million in 2001. Worldwide childrens nutritional sales increased 24%, including a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $383 million in 2002 from $308 million in 2001, as a result of a 53% increase in sales of ENFAGROW, primarily across the Pacific region, to $121 million in 2002. 42 Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Nutritionals segment increased to $542 million in 2003 from $486 million in 2002. This increase is primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL in the United States. In 2002, earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Nutritionals segment decreased to $486 million from $517 million in 2001 as a result of increased promotional spending and sales force expenses related to the ENFAMIL product line. Other Healthcare The Other Healthcare segment includes ConvaTec, the Medical Imaging business and Consumer Medicines in the United States and Japan. Sales in the Other Healthcare segment increased 8% to $1,705 million in 2003 from $1,573 million in 2002. In 2003, the Other Healthcare sales increase was a result of a 2% increase due to volume, a 1% increase from changes in selling prices and a 5% increase due to foreign exchange. In 2002, sales in this segment increased 28% to $1,573 million, including $462 million of sales from Medical Imaging, which was purchased in October 2001 as part of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition. The Other Healthcare sales increase in 2002 was a result of a 25% increase due to volume, a 2% increase from changes in selling prices and a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. Other Healthcare sales by business were as follows: 2003 Restated 2002 Restated 2001 % Change 2003 to 2002 2002 to 2001 (dollars in millions) ConvaTec $ 843 $ 734 $ 710 15 % 3 % Medical Imaging 508 462 98 10 % * * Consumer Medicines 354 377 424 (6 %) (11 %) Total Other Healthcare $ 1,705 $ 1,573 $ 1,232 8 % 28 % ** In excess of 200%. In 2003, the increase in ConvaTec sales was due to a 13% increase, including a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact, in worldwide sales of ostomy products to $512 million and strong growth of worldwide wound care products, which increased 17%, including a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $319 million. Foreign exchange in 2003 had a 9% favorable effect on sales. In 2002, the increase in ConvaTec sales was due to a 1% increase in worldwide sales of ostomy products to $453 million and strong growth of worldwide wound care products, which increased 10% to $273 million. Foreign exchange contributed 1% to the sales increase in 2002. In 2003, the increase in Medical Imaging sales was from a 4% increase in volume, a 4% increase from changes in selling prices and a 2% increase due to foreign exchange. Worldwide sales of CARDIOLITE increased 8% to $324 million from $299 million in 2002. The Medical Imaging business was purchased in October 2001 as part of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition. The steady decline in sales of Consumer Medicines, from $424 million in 2001 to $377 million in 2002 to $354 million in 2003, is in part due to distributors reducing inventory levels to more desirable levels. Consumption of EXCEDRIN and other consumer brands remain flat. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Other Healthcare segment decreased to $408 million in 2003 from $427 million in 2002, primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix and inventory write offs for EXCEDRIN QUICKTABS in the Consumer Medicines business. In 2002, earnings before minority interest and income taxes in this segment increased to $427 million from $328 million in 2001, primarily due to the strong growth in the ConvaTec business and the addition of the Medical Imaging business in October 2001. Geographic Areas The Companys products are available in virtually every country in the world. The largest markets are in the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy and Canada. Sales in the United States increased 14% in 2003, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX*, the OTN segment, the PRAVACHOL franchise, ABILIFY* (total revenue), GLUCOVANCE* and PARAPLATIN. These sales increases were partially offset by the continued impact of generic competition in the United States on GLUCOPHAGE* IR and TAXOL&reg; and the result of loss of exclusivity and a label change indicating a potential serious side effect of SERZONE. In 2002, sales in the United States decreased 4%, primarily due to the impact of generic competition in the United States on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL&reg; and BUSPAR and, to a lesser extent, the buildup in the prior period of inventory levels at those U.S. wholesalers not accounted for under the consignment model and the subsequent workdown in 2002. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in PLAVIX* sales and the addition of the products acquired from DuPont. 43 DuPont Pharmaceuticals U.S. pharmaceuticals sales in 2002 were $603 million. The Companys acquisition of DuPont Pharmaceuticals was completed on October 1, 2001. For information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, refer to the table within Item 1. Business Business Segments Pharmaceutical Segment, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Companys primary care pharmaceutical products. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 23%, including a 16% increase from foreign exchange, as a result of sales growth of PRAVACHOL in France, TAXOL&reg; in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, analgesics in France, PLAVIX* in Germany and Spain, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Italy and SUSTIVA in Spain. The favorable impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the euro. In 2002, sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 12%, including a 4% increase from foreign exchange, as a result of the strong growth of PRAVACHOL in France and the United Kingdom, PLAVIX* in Spain, and the addition of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals products in several markets in the region. DuPont Pharmaceuticals sales in the region were $309 million in 2002. Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 10%, including a 5% decrease from foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was primarily in Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela. In 2002, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 6%, including an 8% decrease from foreign exchange. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was primarily in Brazil and Argentina. The underlying sales growth was primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and of nutritional products in Mexico. Pacific region sales increased 12%, including a 6% increase from foreign exchange in 2003, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL&reg; in Japan and increased sales of ENFAGROW throughout the region. In 2002, sales in the Pacific region increased 12%, including a 2% decrease from foreign exchange. Products with strong growth included TAXOL&reg; and PARAPLATIN in Japan and nutritional products in China and Indonesia. Developments In February 2004, the FDA approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ERBITUX*, the anticancer agent that the Company is developing in partnership with ImClone. ERBITUX* Injection is for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy. In accordance with the agreement, the Company paid ImClone $250 million in March 2004 as a milestone payment for the approval of ERBITUX* by the FDA. In January 2004, the Company announced that it has agreed to acquire Acordis Specialty Fibres (Acordis), a privately held company based in the United Kingdom that licenses patent rights and supplies materials to ConvaTec for its Wound Therapeutics line. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval which has not been received. If the transaction is completed, the Company expects to record an in process research and development charge between $50 million to $70 million. In December 2003, the Company confirmed that Mead Johnson, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, had reached an agreement with Novartis AG to sell to Novartis its Adult Nutritional business, brands, trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights for $385 million, including $20 million contingent on a product conversion and a $22 million upfront payment for a supply agreement. The transaction closed in February 2004 and a pre tax gain of approximately $290 million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2004. In 2003, Adult Nutritional products recorded sales of over $200 million. In December 2003, the Company and Lexicon Genetics Incorporated (Lexicon) formed a broad alliance for drug discovery, development and commercialization in the neuroscience field. The alliance is designed to accelerate the discovery and development of breakthrough therapies to address significant, unmet medical needs in psychiatry and neurology. The Company made and expensed an initial payment of $36 million in 2003. In October 2003, the Company and Corgentech Inc., a biotechnology company, entered into an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize Corgentechs E2F Decoy (edifoligide), a treatment for the prevention of vein graft failure following coronary artery bypass graft and peripheral artery bypass graft surgery. The product is currently in Phase III clinical trials and the FDA has granted fast track status for both indications. The Company made and expensed an initial payment of $45 million in 2003. Further, there are potential clinical and regulatory milestone payments of $205 million, and arrangements for profit sharing. In August 2003, PRAVIGARD PAC (Buffered Aspirin and Pravastatin Sodium) tablets were launched in the United States. In July 2003, REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, was launched in the United States. On March 2, 2004, the Company received marketing approval for REYATAZ in the EU. 44 In August 2003, the Company entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Flamel Technologies S.A. to develop and market BASULIN, the first controlled release, unmodified human insulin to be developed as a once daily injection for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. BASULIN is now entering Phase II clinical development. Under the agreement, the Company will lead and assume the cost of future development and manufacturing efforts for BASULIN and will have exclusive worldwide rights to the product. The Company made and expensed an initial payment of $20 million in October 2003, with the potential for an additional $145 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments over time, and royalty payments on product sales. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with $4.0 billion at December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 billion of such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries, which the Company does not expect to repatriate in the foreseeable future. In 2004, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with borrowings from the capital markets, to sufficiently cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and dividends in the U.S. Repatriation to the United States would require additional tax provisions not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion of this matter, see Critical Accounting Policies Income Taxes below. Working capital increased to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of an increase in marketable securities, and a decrease in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by increased accrued expenses. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near term operations. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Marketable securities at December 31, 2003 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate instruments with a AAA/aaa credit rating. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company considers it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates, and that they can be liquidated for cash at short notice. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 1.2% and 1.4% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, while interest yields on marketable securities averaged 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Long term debt at December 31, 2003, was denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also included Japanese yen long term debt of $293 million. Long term debt increased to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to the $1.0 billion of fixed rate notes and $1.2 billion of floating rate convertible debentures issued in August 2003 and October 2003, respectively. The proceeds from these issuances were used to repay short term borrowings and fund the cash needs of the U.S. operations. The convertible debentures mature in 2023, callable at par at any time on or after September 21, 2008 by the issuer, and are convertible into Company common stock at 24.2248 shares per $1,000 debenture ($41.28 per share), subject to increases up to a maximum of 38.7597 shares per $1,000 debenture based on increases in the market price of the stock above $41.28 per share, plus anti dilution and certain other adjustments. Interest is payable quarterly at an annual rate equal to 3 month LIBOR, reset quarterly, minus 0.50%. A majority of the Companys debt is fixed rate. The Company, however, has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $5.5 billion of its long term debt. Interest expense in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $488 million, $410 million, and $182 million, respectively. There was no U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003. U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 was $1,158 million with an average interest rate of 1.40%. The average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, on international short term borrowings were 8.04% and 9.58%, respectively, and on current installments of long term debt were 1.33% and 2.56%, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had two revolving credit facilities, totaling $1.0 billion in aggregate, as support for its domestic commercial paper program. These facilities were established in September 2001 and August 2003, respectively, with a syndicate of lenders, and are extendable at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. One of the revolving credit facilities has certain financial covenants, of which the Company is in compliance with as of December 31, 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The Company had unused short term lines of credit with foreign banks of $363 million and $321 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In July 2003, Standard & Poors lowered its long term credit rating on the Company from AA to AA . In addition, Standard & Poors affirmed its A 1+ short term rating. In April 2003, Moodys Investors Service lowered the Companys long term credit rating from Aa2 to A1. In March 2003, Moodys affirmed the Prime 1 short term credit rating for the Company. On March 10, 2004, Standard & Poors placed both long term and short term ratings of the Company on watch with negative implications. Moodys long term credit rating remains on negative outlook. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $3.5 billion in 2003, $0.9 billion in 2002 and $5.4 billion in 2001. The increase in 2003 is attributable to higher net earnings and income tax payments in 2002 primarily related to the gain arising from the sale of the Clairol business. Cash flow from operations also included pension contributions of $332 million, $554 million and $300 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash provided from operations and borrowings were primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of $6.5 billion and to repurchase 32 million shares at a cost of $1.8 billion in 2002 and 2001. The Company has also invested $2.9 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities. 45 During 2003, the Company did not purchase any of its common stock. The Company repurchased 5 million and 27 million shares of common stock at a cost of $164 million and $1,589 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, bringing the total shares acquired since the share repurchase programs inception to 372 million shares. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for general corporate purposes. Employment levels of 44,000 at December 2003 remained constant compared to prior year levels. Dividends declared per common share in each of the years 2003 and 2002 were $1.12 and in 2001 were $1.11. In December 2003, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.28 per common share and an indicated dividend for the full year 2004 of $1.12 per share. The Companys financial condition and liquidity could be affected by obligations to make milestone or other one time payments and by the outcome of pending litigations and investigations, including the challenge to the PLAVIX* patent.

In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheet.
