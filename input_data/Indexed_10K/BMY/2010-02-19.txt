Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Summary Bristol Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biopharmaceutical company, consisting of global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and international consumer medicines businesses, whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We license, manufacture, market, distribute and sell products on a global basis. In February 2009, Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (Mead Johnson) completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its Class A common stock. Post IPO, we held an 83.1% interest in Mead Johnson. On December 23, 2009, we completed an exchange offer of our previously held 170 million shares of Mead Johnson for 269 million outstanding shares of our stock. Mead Johnsons financial results, previously reported as a separate segment, have been reported as discontinued operations for all years presented. We continued to execute our string of pearls strategy in 2009 with the acquisition of Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) in September 2009, and through the various collaboration agreements entered into during the year. The divestiture of Mead Johnson and continued execution of the string of pearls strategy has allowed us to become a more focused biopharmaceutical company. We are meeting our productivity transformation initiative (PTI) objectives and have implemented a culture of continuous improvement. 2009 Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of operating activity: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 18,808 $ 17,715 BioPharmaceutical Segment Results 4,492 3,538 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 3,239 2,697 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to BMS 7,373 2,550 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS 10,612 5,247 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 1.63 1.35 Non GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 1.85 1.49 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 9,883 8,453 Net Sales Net sales increased 6%, or 8% excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. U.S. net sales increased 12% to $11.9 billion in 2009. International net sales decreased 3%, or increased 3% excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $6.9 billion. Sales growth in 2009 was led by continued increases in PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate) of 10%, and ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) of 20%. The virology portfolio continued to demonstrate strong sales growth in 2009, led by BARACLUDE (entecavir) of 36%, the SUSTIVA (efavirenz) Franchise of 11% and REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate) of 8%. Worldwide growth of ORENCIA (abatacept) of 37% and SPRYCEL (dasatinib) of 36%. ERBITUX (cetuximab) net sales were down 9%. ONGLYZA (saxagliptin), a DPP IV inhibitor, has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and Denmark. Net sales were $24 million in 2009. 35 Table of Contents BioPharmaceutical Segment Results The increase in BioPharmaceutical segment results is attributed to: Increased net sales of various key products noted above. More favorable gross margin percentage attributed to favorable foreign exchange, higher average selling prices, a more favorable product mix and realized efficiencies from PTI. More efficient and reduced spending within marketing, selling and administrative. Partially offset by increased investments within our research and development pipeline. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb Company The increase is attributed to: Improved segment results. Partially offset by unfavorable impact of specified items in 2009 the prior year includes a gain on sale of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) shares. Additional taxes on higher income levels; however, the effective tax rate was reduced by 170 basis points to 21.1%. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb Company In 2009, we completed the split off of Mead Johnson resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $7.2 billion. The results of the Mead Johnson business and related gain are included in discontinued operations for all years presented. In addition to the results of Mead Johnson, the 2008 results include a $2.0 billion after tax gain on the divestiture of ConvaTec, a $43 million after tax loss on the divestiture of Medical Imaging and their operating results prior to the divestitures. Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 21% during 2009 due to the improved operating results driven by the activities discussed above. The EPS impact of the 269 million share reduction resulting from the Mead Johnson split off was minimal due to the relatively short period that the lower share count was outstanding. Our non GAAP financial measures, including non GAAP earnings from continuing operations and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. Our non GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 24% during 2009 after adjusting for specified items of $428 million in 2009 and $278 million in 2008. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures, see Specified Items and Non GAAP Financial Measures below. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Sources of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $4.1 billion generated from operating activities; net proceeds from Mead Johnsons issuance of various notes and draw down from their credit facility of $1.7 billion, which were used to repay intercompany loans prior to the split off; net proceeds of $782 million from the Mead Johnson IPO, and proceeds of $456 million from the sale of various mature businesses and trademarks. These sources were more than adequate to fund dividend payments of $2.5 billion, Medarex business acquisition of $2.3 billion and capital expenditures of $730 million. Business Environment We conduct our business primarily within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect sales of our products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; product labeling; quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations; and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of our new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. We manufacture branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of our leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative products commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, we can lose a major portion of that products sales in a short period of time. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. 36 Table of Contents However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involve more complex processes which are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on our net sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could result in major changes in the current healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the U.S. This legislation has had a modest favorable impact on us as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage. At the same time, there continues to be a potential negative impact on the U.S. biopharmaceuticals business that could result from pricing pressures or controls. In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in environments of government mandated, cost containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the UK, for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some countries. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of our strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and we generally have been successful in having our major products included. We believe that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical/biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become a larger percentage of our product portfolio, we will continue to make arrangements with third party manufacturers and to make substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. One such investment is a new, state of the art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts, the construction of which was substantially completed in 2009. We expect to submit the site for regulatory approval in 2011. We have maintained a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position, which is dependent on our success in discovering, developing and delivering innovative, cost effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases. We are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy We continue to execute our multi year strategy which has allowed us to transform into a next generation biopharmaceutical company. The strategy encompasses all aspects and all geographies of the business and has yielded and will continue to yield substantial cost savings and cost avoidance which increases our financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive market opportunities that may arise. With the completion of the Mead Johnson split off as well as the prior year dispositions of the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, we are now operating within our core biopharmaceutical business focus. In 2009, we completed the sale of our mature brands businesses and related manufacturing facilities in the Asia Pacific region, China, Pakistan, Egypt and Australia. We are also reducing the number of facilities in our global manufacturing network. We are also allocating resources to continue our string of pearls strategy and enable strategic transactions, which could range from collaboration and license agreements to the acquisition of companies. In September 2009, we completed our acquisition of Medarex and entered into or restructured collaboration agreements with various companies during 2009, including Alder Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder), Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics), and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) in January 2010. 37 Table of Contents Managing costs is another part of our overall strategy. We have implemented all PTI initiatives resulting in the incurrence of $1.3 billion in costs. We are on target to create a total of $2.5 billion in annual productivity savings and cost avoidance by 2012 of which approximately 90% is expected to be realized by the end of 2010. Subsequent to the PTI, we have further implemented a strategic process designed to achieve a culture of continuous improvement to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness and to continue to improve our cost base. We will continue to focus on the development of our biopharmaceuticals business and will maintain growth by investing in research and development as well as in key growth products, including specialty and biologic medicines and cardiovascular and metabolic drugs. ONGLYZA has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, the UK and Denmark. We have refined our focus on emerging markets which represent significant opportunities for growth. We have identified five emerging markets on which to focus Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey. The emerging public health interests of these countries best align with our strategy as well as our current portfolio and pipeline. Product and Pipeline Developments Belatacept In September 2009, we announced that the FDA has accepted, for filing and review, our submission of a biologic license application for belatacept, which is under development for use in kidney transplantation. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal for FDA action is May 1, 2010. In January 2010, the FDA announced that its Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee plans to meet on March 1, 2010 to provide advice regarding this application. In May 2009, belatacept, an investigational co stimulation blocker being studied for use in solid organ transplantation, was the subject of nine company sponsored clinical presentations (including the first Phase III data) at the American Transplant Congress. The data suggest that belatacept may represent a promising therapeutic option for kidney transplant patients. Dapagliflozin In October 2009, we announced results from a 24 week Phase III clinical study, which demonstrated that the investigational drug dapagliflozin, added to metformin, provided significant mean reductions in the primary endpoint, glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) and in the secondary endpoint, fasting plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone, as compared to placebo plus metformin. The study also showed that individuals receiving dapagliflozin had statistically greater mean reduction in body weight compared to individuals taking placebo. In June 2009, at the American Diabetes Association Annual Scientific Sessions, a 12 week study of dapagliflozin was presented which demonstrated improved glycemic control in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients who were treated with high doses of insulin and common oral anti diabetic medicines. In March 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) published findings from a 12 week, Phase IIb dose ranging study that dapagliflozin produced clinically meaningful reductions across all key glycemic measures studied in treatment naive type 2 diabetes patients, compared to placebo. The study findings also showed that patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced greater reductions in body weight compared to patients on placebo. Apixaban In December 2009, the Company and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) announced plans to submit a regulatory filing in the first half of 2010 for apixaban in Europe. The companies plan to file for regulatory approval of apixaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery. The application will be supported by ADVANCE 2 and ADVANCE 3, two clinical trials that evaluated apixaban versus the European dosing regimen of enoxaparin for prevention of VTE in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Apixaban is a novel, oral, highly selective Factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of agents being studied for the potential to prevent and treat blood clots in the veins and arteries. In July 2009, the results of the apixaban ADVANCE 2 study were presented at a late breaking clinical trial session at the Congress of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. The studys results demonstrated that apixaban was superior to the European regimen of enoxaparin (standard of care) for reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery and showed lower observed bleeding rates compared to enoxaparin. The study also showed that the overall safety profile for apixaban was similar to enoxaparin. In March 2009, the Company and Pfizer initiated a Phase III program for the treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome. 38 Table of Contents Ipilimumab In May 2009, the Company and Medarex announced, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, that updated survival results from follow up extensions of three Phase II studies show a two year survival ranging from 30% to 42% in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma (Stage III or IV). NTC 801 In March 2009, we announced a global collaboration with Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. and Teijin Pharma Limited (Nissan) for the development and commercialization of NTC 801, a selective inhibitor of the acetylcholine activated potassium ion channel, currently in Phase I development in Japan, for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. PEG Interferon Lambda In November 2009, at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the Company and ZymoGenetics presented final Phase Ib results for PEG Interferon lambda in hepatitis C. Antiviral activity was seen at all dose levels tested and the results support moving to dose ranging Phase II studies in treatment na&iuml;ve hepatitis C patients. In January 2009, we announced a global collaboration with ZymoGenetics on our PEG Interferon lambda, a novel type 3 interferon currently in Phase Ib development for the treatment of hepatitis C. In April 2009, the Company and ZymoGenetics announced positive 4 week results of PEG Interferon lambda with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C from an ongoing Phase Ib clinical trial. XL184 In October 2009, the Company and Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis) reported new Phase II data for the developmental compound XL184 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. XL184 showed promising activity in GBM patients receiving a daily dose of 125 milligrams of the compound. In May 2009, the Company and Exelixis reported, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, encouraging data from an ongoing Phase II trial of XL184 in patients with previously treated GBM. ABILIFY* In November 2009, the Company and Otsuka announced that the FDA approved ABILIFY* for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17 years). In November 2009, the Company and Otsuka following discussions with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), withdrew the marketing authorization application in the EU for a new indication for ABILIFY* in the treatment of major depressive episodes, as an adjunctive therapy, in patients who have had an inadequate response to previous treatment with antidepressants. ERBITUX* In September 2009, at the European Cancer Organisation and European Society of Medical Oncology Multidisciplinary Congress, data was presented on two Phase III ERBITUX* studies in first line metastatic colorectal cancer patients. A retrospective analysis of the Phase III CRYSTAL study demonstrated that ERBITUX*, when added to a FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen, was shown to increase progression free survival (PFS) median overall survival in first line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients compared to those receiving FOLFIRI alone. In a subset of patients with mCRC who have tumors without K ras mutations (commonly referred to as wild type K ras), median overall survival was increased to 23.5 months in patients who received ERBITUX* plus FOLFIRI compared to 20 months for those taking FOLFIRI alone. Another Phase III study of ERBITUX* plus chemotherapy (primarily capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) in first line mCRC, known as COIN, was conducted in the UK by the Medical Research Council. The COIN study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. In July 2009, the Company and Lilly announced that the FDA had approved revisions to the U.S. prescribing information for ERBITUX* concerning the treatment of patients with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressing mCRC. The labeling revisions include a modification which states that ERBITUX* is not recommended for patients whose tumors had K ras mutations in codon 12 or 13. An estimated 40% of patients with mCRC have tumors with such K ras mutations while approximately 60% of patients with mCRC have tumors without K ras mutations. In March 2009, the Company and Lilly announced that the companies received a complete response letter from the FDA for the first line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for ERBITUX*. In its complete response letter the FDA requested an additional pharmacokinetic study to confirm the comparability of ERBITUX* used in 39 Table of Contents the first line head and neck submission as compared to the ERBITUX* currently marketed in the United States. As previously announced, the Company and Lilly recently withdrew the advanced non small cell lung cancer sBLA for ERBITUX* because of the same matter. In both cases, the companies continue to work with the FDA to confirm pharmacokinetic comparability. IXEMPRA In March 2009, we withdrew our marketing authorization application for IXEMPRA (ixabepilone), which was submitted to the European Medicines Agency in September 2007. ALD518 In November 2009, the Company and Alder entered into a global agreement for the development and commercialization of ALD518, a novel biologic that has completed Phase IIa development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ALD518 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL 6. PLAVIX* In November 2009, the U.S. PLAVIX* label was updated with new warnings on the use of PRILOSEC* (omeprazole) and certain other drugs that could interfere with PLAVIX* by reducing its effectiveness. The label was also updated to include warnings about the variability of response attributed to CYP 2C19 genetic polymorphisms. The company and sanofi are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding possible additional changes to the U.S. PLAVIX* label. In August 2009, the OASIS study group presented initial results of the CURRENT OASIS 7 clinical trial at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Barcelona. The large scale, global study provided information about an intensified dose regimen of PLAVIX* in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients managed by an early invasive strategy with an intent for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study showed no added benefit on the composite primary end point (cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke at 30 days) with the higher dose in the entire ACS study population. For clinically relevant subgroups pre specified for preliminary analysis, such as the PCI group (70% of the trial population), potentially medically relevant differences in patient outcomes were observed. In those subgroups, analysis showed an improvement in outcome for PCI patients taking the higher PLAVIX* dose regimen (600 mg loading/150 mg for days 2 7/75 mg for days 8 30) over the standard dose regimen (300 mg loading/75 mg for days 2 30), as shown by a 15% reduction of the same composite end point of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke. There was a statistically significant increase in the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding with the high dose compared to the standard dose PLAVIX* regimen in both the overall trial population and the PCI population. In March 2009, the Company and sanofi aventis (sanofi) announced new findings from their Active A trial. The investigational study on PLAVIX* provided results that demonstrated that, for patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and could not take an oral anticoagulant, taking PLAVIX* in addition to aspirin significantly reduced major vascular events by 11% over aspirin alone. The greatest benefit was in reduction of stroke by 28%, which is the primary goal of physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation. Compared to aspirin alone, taking PLAVIX* in addition to aspirin significantly and as expected increased the rate of major bleeding. ONGLYZA In December 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca submitted an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA plus metformin HCl extended release tablets. The FDA is currently reviewing the submission. In October 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for ONGLYZA, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, in all 27 countries of the European Union to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with either metformin, a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, when any of these other agents alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycemic control. In October 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results of the 18 week Phase IIIb study in adults with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy alone found that the addition of ONGLYZA 5mg per day to metformin treatment achieved the primary objective of demonstrating non inferiority compared to the addition of JANUVIA*(sitagliptin) 100mg per day to metformin treatment in reducing HbA1c from baseline. In July 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the FDA approved ONGLYZA. ONGLYZA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar (glycemic) control in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. ONGLYZA once daily can be used in combination with commonly prescribed oral anti diabetic medications, metformin, sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones, or as a monotherapy to significantly reduce glycosylated hemoglobin levels. 40 Table of Contents In June 2009, at the American Diabetes Association Annual Scientific Sessions, interim analysis (at 102 weeks) of a 42 month long term Phase III extension study was presented which showed that when ONGLYZA was added to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, the profile of adverse events was consistent with that seen at 24 weeks, and the treatment regimen produced long term glycemic improvement. ORENCIA In January 2010, the European Commission approved ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderate to severe active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients six years of age and older who have had an insufficient response to other disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs, including at least one TNF inhibitor. In October 2009, we announced that new clinical data support continued development of a subcutaneous administration of ORENCIA for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The subcutaneous program utilizes a new formulation of ORENCIA, which has been specifically designed for subcutaneous administration. These data, from a 4 month open label trial involving 100 patients, were presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Scientific Meeting. The study showed that weekly administration of a 125 mg subcutaneous dose of ORENCIA resulted in minimal, transient immunogenicity prior to month 4 after repeat dosing. The immunogenicity was similar whether ORENCIA was administered in combination with methotrexate, a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, or as a monotherapy. At month four, patients had no antibody response to subcutaneous ORENCIA. In October 2009, we announced two year results of a study that supports use of ORENCIA for methotrexate na&iuml;ve patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of less than or equal to two years duration. The data from the AGREE study, which compared patients treated with ORENCIA plus methotrexate versus patients treated with methotrexate alone, show that patients taking ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate achieved sustained low disease activity scores at 24 months. The data also showed that ORENCIA plus methotrexate can inhibit radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis and improve physical function in addition to relieving pain, swelling and fatigue. The safety profile for the open label period was similar to the double blind period of the study. In August 2009, we announced that clinical data added to the labeling for ORENCIA support use of ORENCIA for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of less than or equal to two years duration. The efficacy and safety data further support use of ORENCIA in new to biologic patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In June 2009, we announced, at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR), the results of two studies that demonstrated the consistent safety and effectiveness over five and seven years of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. SPRYCEL In December 2009, at the 51st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, Phase II data on SPRYCEL was presented which suggested that SPRYCEL could provide chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with a more rapid, improved response than the currently available first line treatment, imatinib. Results from a Phase III head to head trial (called DASISION) of SPRYCEL and imatinib mesylate in first line treatment of CML are expected to be announced in the first half of 2010. In May 2009, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, we presented interim results from two Phase II SPRYCEL studies, which demonstrate that SPRYCEL may have potential as a treatment for a castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A Phase III study of SPRYCEL in CRPC is currently ongoing. In May 2009, we announced that the FDA has granted full approval for SPRYCEL for the treatment of adults in all phases of CML (chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including GLEEVEC* (imatinib mesylate). REYATAZ In November 2009, we announced a U.S. labeling update for REYATAZ. The label for the medicine now includes long term data from the CASTLE Study, which showed that a once daily regimen of REYATAZ and ritonavir as part of combination therapy in previously untreated adult patients infected with HIV 1 led to an enduring virologic response through 96 weeks of treatment. BARACLUDE In October 2009, at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, we announced 48 week data for BARACLUDE in chronic hepatitis B patients with evidence of decompensated cirrhosis. In the patient population studied, BARACLUDE demonstrated greater viral suppression compared to adefovir. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the Mead Johnson business prior to its split off in December 2009, the ConvaTec business prior to its divestiture in August 2008, and the Medical Imaging business prior to its divestiture in January 2008. These businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations for all years presented, see Discontinued Operations below. Our results of continuing operations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 % Change2009 vs. 2008 % Change2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 6 % 13 % Total Expenses $ 13,206 $ 12,939 $ 13,094 2 % (1 )% Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes $ 5,602 $ 4,776 $ 2,523 17 % 89 % % of net sales 29.8 % 27.0 % 16.2 % Provision for Income Taxes $ 1,182 $ 1,090 $ 471 8 % 131 % Effective tax rate 21.1 % 22.8 % 18.7 % Net Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 4,420 $ 3,686 $ 2,052 20 % 80 % % of net sales 23.5 % 20.8 % 13.1 % Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest $ 1,181 $ 989 $ 756 19 % 31 % % of net sales 6.3 % 5.6 % 4.8 % Attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb Company $ 3,239 $ 2,697 $ 1,296 20 % 108 % % of net sales 17.2 % 15.2 % 8.3 % Net Sales The composition of the change in net sales was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Analysis of % Change Analysis of % Change Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Total Change Volume Price ForeignExchange Total Change Volume Price ForeignExchange U.S. $ 11,909 $ 10,611 $ 8,992 12 % 5 % 7 % 18 % 11 % 7 % Non U.S. 6,899 7,104 6,625 (3 )% 3 % (6 )% 7 % 3 % (1 )% 5 % Total $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 6 % 4 % 4 % (2 )% 13 % 8 % 3 % 2 % In 2009, most of the key U.S. products contributed to the growth in net sales. PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented 47% and 17% of total U.S. net sales and contributed 49% and 31% of total growth in U.S. net sales, respectively. In 2008, PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented 46% and 16% of total U.S. net sales and contributed 53% and 23% of total growth in U.S. net sales, respectively. International net sales decrease in 2009 and increase in 2008 were impacted by the fluctuating value of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies when compared to the previous periods. Excluding foreign exchange, international net sales increased 3% in 2009 due to growth in various key products, including BARACLUDE, the HIV portfolio, SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and ORENCIA, which more than offset decreases in PLAVIX* net sales stemming from increased generic competition. Our reported international net sales do not include copromotion sales reported by our alliance partner, sanofi for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, which decreased in 2009 due to generic competition. Net sales of mature brands and businesses that were divested during 2007 through 2009 represented approximately 1% of total net sales. Further detail on both domestic and international key product net sales are discussed below. In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Estimated End User Demand below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key pharmaceutical and new products. The U.S. and non U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross to net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. 42 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross to net sales adjustments were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Gross Sales $ 20,555 $ 19,370 $ 17,097 Gross to Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge Backs (513 ) (487 ) (504 ) Cash Discounts (253 ) (235 ) (191 ) Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (439 ) (360 ) (319 ) Medicaid Rebates (229 ) (205 ) (169 ) Sales Returns (101 ) (163 ) (87 ) Other Adjustments (212 ) (205 ) (210 ) Total Gross to Net Sales Adjustments (1,747 ) (1,655 ) (1,480 ) Net Sales $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 The gross to net sales adjustments are primarily a function of gross sales and activity is typically correlated with current sales trends as is managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts and other adjustments. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts and Medicaid rebates are also affected by changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discount rates. In 2009, gross to net sales adjustments increased by 6%. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts increased by 22% primarily due to higher PLAVIX* Medicare sales and an increase in contractual discount rates. Sales returns decreased by 38% primarily due to lower provisions for PRAVACHOL and ZERIT, partially offset by increased provisions for SPRYCEL and mature brands driven by higher than anticipated sales returns. In 2008, the increase in the gross to net sales adjustments is attributed to increased provisions for PRAVACHOL, driven by higher sales returns than previously estimated and for ZERIT due to loss of exclusivity.

The impact of the revised calculation was a net overpayment of Medicaid rebates of $60 million. The 2008 increase in sales returns is primarily attributed to increased provisions for PRAVACHOL, driven by higher retail sales returns than previously assumed, and the loss of exclusivity for ZERIT. 43 Table of Contents Net sales of key products represent 81% of total net sales in 2009, 77% in 2008 and 71% in 2007. The following table details U.S. and international net sales by key products, the percentage change from the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 4% in 2009 and 19% in 2008. International net sales decreased in 2009 and 2008 due to the launch of alternative salt forms of clopidogrel and or generic clopidogrel bisulfate in over half of the EU countries since August 2008, with additional launches expected through 2010. Given the wide spread launch of alternative salt forms and generics, we expect continued erosion of sales in the EU which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies PLAVIX* Litigation, for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and EU. AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance U.S. net sales decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 9% decrease in estimated total U.S. prescription demand partially offset by higher average net selling prices. International net sales increased primarily due to higher average net selling prices partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In 2008, worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher average net selling prices which more than offset decline in overall demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 7%. REYATAZ a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 8% in 2009 and 14% in 2008, and higher average net selling prices. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased primarily due to higher demand across most markets with Europe being the key driver due to the June 2008 approval for first line treatment. SUSTIVA Franchise a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA, an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead. In 2009 and 2008, U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher demand as well as higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 10% in 2009 and 14% in 2008. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact in 2009 primarily due to continued demand generated from the launch of ATRIPLA* in Canada and the EU in the fourth quarter of 2007. BARACLUDE an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B Worldwide net sales in 2009 and 2008 increased primarily due to continued strong growth in international markets. There continues to be increased awareness and acceptance of its long term efficacy, safety and resistance data as evidenced by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease treatment guidelines that recommended BARACLUDE as a first line treatment option. ERBITUX* a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly. Sold by us almost exclusively in the U.S., the net sales in 2009 decreased primarily due to study results released in 2008 regarding the impact of the K ras gene expression on the effectiveness in patients with colorectal cancer. Sales increase in 2008 is attributable to increased demand for a 2008 indication for usage in the treatment of head and neck cancer. SPRYCEL an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC*, which is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka. Worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher demand in previously launched markets, growth attributed to recently launched markets as well as higher U.S. average net selling prices. 45 Table of Contents IXEMPRA a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka The net sales increase in 2008 reflects the launch of the product in the U.S. in October 2007. ABILIFY* an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka U.S. net sales increased primarily due to increased overall demand, new indications for certain patients with bipolar 1 disorder and major depressive disorder, and higher average net selling prices. The 2009 increase was partially offset by $49 million of amortization of the $400 million extension payment made to Otsuka in April 2009. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 26% in 2009 and 23% in 2008. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased due to increased prescription demand, which was aided by a new bipolar indication in the second quarter of 2008 in the EU offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact in 2009. ORENCIA a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti tumor necrosis factor therapy In 2009, worldwide net sales increased primarily due to increased demand. In 2008, the U.S. net sales increase was primarily due to continued demand growth. The international net sales increase reflected the May 2007 product launch in Europe. ONGLYZA once daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ONGLYZA has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, the UK and Denmark. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels such as hospitals, home healthcare, clinics, federal facilities including VA hospitals, and long term care, among others. In the first quarter of 2009, we changed our service provider for U.S. prescription data to Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. (WK), a supplier of market research audit data for the pharmaceutical industry, for external reporting purposes and internal demand for most products. Prior to 2009, we used prescription data based on the Next Generation Prescription Service Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS Health (IMS). We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing estimate calculation methodologies, processes, and analyzing internal and third party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze our own and third parties data used in such calculations. The estimated prescription data is based on the Source Prescription Audit provided by the above suppliers and is a product of their respective recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90 day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30 day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand, with respect to retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting. 46 Table of Contents Estimated End User Demand The following tables set forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: (i) total U.S. net sales for the year; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for the year; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third party data on a weighted average basis, and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

The months on hand relates only to SUSTIVA. (b) ERBITUX*, IXEMPRA and ORENCIA are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. (c) IXEMPRA was launched in the U.S. in October 2007. (d) ONGLYZA was launched in the U.S. in August 2009. Month on hand ratio of 3.7 is estimated by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out movement of the product from the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over a period of 31 days. ** Change in excess of 200% Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. We disclosed U.S. products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2009, and international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2009. The following products met those criteria: At December 31, 2009, ONGLYZA, a type 2 diabetes product, had approximately 3.7 months of inventory on hand. The inventory level on hand was due to the product launch in August 2009. At September 30, 2009, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2008. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of private pharmacists in France. At September 30, 2009, FERVEX, a cold and flu product had approximately 1.7 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.4 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2008. The increased level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of private pharmacists in France and the initial stocking of a new distributor in Russia. In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we determined our months on hand estimates using information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out movement of products provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. For products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for our businesses outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out movement information and the reliability of third party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where 47 Table of Contents direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third party market research data related to prescription trends and end user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2009 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10 K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10 Q. Geographic Areas In general, our products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Japan, Spain, Canada, Italy, Germany, China and Mexico. Our net sales by geographic areas, based on the location of the customer, were as follows: Net Sales % Change % of Total Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs.2008 2008 vs.2007 2009 2008 2007 United States $ 11,909 $ 10,611 $ 8,992 12 % 18 % 63 % 60 % 58 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,206 4,370 3,914 (4 )% 12 % 22 % 25 % 25 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,300 1,329 1,390 (2 )% (4 )% 7 % 7 % 9 % Pacific 1,393 1,405 1,321 (1 )% 6 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Total $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 6 % 13 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Net sales in the U.S. increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to items previously discussed in Net Sales above. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 7% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and increased generic competition for PLAVIX*, partially offset by sales growth in major European markets for the HIV portfolio, BARACLUDE, ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. In 2008, net sales increased primarily due to sales growth in major European markets for SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and the HIV hepatitis portfolio and a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. Net sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 9% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by increased net sales of PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. In 2008, net sales were essentially flat with a minimum foreign exchange impact. Net sales in the Pacific region decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures, partially offset by increased net sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL and 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2008, net sales increased primarily due to sales growth of BARACLUDE in China, Japan and Korea and a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007. The combined net sales in emerging markets which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey approximated 4% of our total net sales in 2009 and 2008 and 3% in 2007. 48 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses % Change % of Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs.2008 2008 vs.2007 2009 2008 2007 Cost of products sold $ 5,140 $ 5,316 $ 4,919 (3 )% 8 % 27.3 % 30.0 % 31.5 % Marketing, selling and administrative 3,946 4,140 3,941 (5 )% 5 % 21.0 % 23.4 % 25.2 % Advertising and product promotion 1,136 1,181 1,097 (4 )% 8 % 6.0 % 6.7 % 7.0 % Research and development 3,647 3,512 3,160 4 % 11 % 19.4 % 19.8 % 20.2 % Acquired in process research and development 32 230 (100 )% (86 )% 0.2 % 1.5 % Provision for restructuring 136 215 180 (37 )% 19 % 0.7 % 1.2 % 1.2 % Litigation expense 132 33 14 ** 136 % 0.7 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Equity in net income of affiliates (550 ) (617 ) (524 ) (11 )% 18 % (2.9 )% (3.5 )% (3.4 )% Gain on sale of ImClone shares (895 ) (100 )% (5.1 )% Other (income)/expense (381 ) 22 77 ** (71 )% (2.0 )% 0.1 % 0.5 % Total Expenses $ 13,206 $ 12,939 $ 13,094 2 % (1 )% 70.2 % 73.0 % 83.8 % ** Change is in excess of 200%. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold consist of material costs, internal labor and overhead of our owned manufacturing sites, third party processing costs, other supply chain costs and changes in foreign currency forward contracts that offset manufacturing related assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Essentially all of these costs are managed primarily through our global manufacturing organization, referred to as Technical Operations. In addition, discovery royalties attributed to licensed products in connection with alliances as well as the amortization of milestone payments that occur on or after regulatory approval are also included. Costs as a percentage of net sales can vary between periods as a result of product mix, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other stranded costs. In addition, changes in foreign currency may also provide volatility given a high percentage of total costs are denominated in foreign currencies. The improvement in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by favorable foreign exchange, higher U.S. average net selling prices, a more favorable product mix and realized manufacturing efficiencies from PTI offset by higher manufacturing costs attributed to inflation. The 2009 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $123 million primarily related to the implementation of PTI compared to $249 million of rationalization charges recognized in 2008. The improvement in costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was primarily attributed to a more favorable product sales mix, higher U.S. average net selling prices, and realized manufacturing savings from PTI. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs attributed to inflation. The 2008 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $249 million primarily related to the implementation of PTI compared to $179 million of rationalization charges recognized in 2007. Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist of employee salary and benefit costs, third party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs and other expenses that are not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses. Most of these expenses are managed through regional commercialization functions or global functions such as finance, law, information technology and human resources. The decrease in 2009 resulted from a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact and efficiencies gained from PTI. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to $109 million of process standardization costs incurred as part of PTI, higher average net selling expenses in support of key products and an unfavorable 2% foreign exchange impact. Advertising and product promotion Advertising and product promotion expenses consist of related media, sample and direct to consumer programs. The decrease in 2009 is attributed to reduced spending on promotion of products nearing patent expirations and a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact, partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and pipeline products. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased promotions for new indications of ABILIFY* in the U.S., increased promotion for ORENCIA and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 49 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development expenses consist of internal salary and benefit costs, third party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies and facility costs. These expenses also include third party licensing fees that are typically paid upfront as well as when regulatory or other contractual milestones are met. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Approximately 85% of these expenses are managed by our global research and development organization. Historically, approximately 75% of the total spend was attributed to development activities with the remainder attributed to preclinical and research activities. These expenses can vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of upfront licensing and milestone payments. The increase in 2009 was attributed to additional spending to support our maturing pipeline and compounds obtained from our string of pearls strategy, offset by a favorable 1% foreign exchange impact. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased upfront licensing and milestone payments, increased spending for pipeline compounds, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The 2008 increase was partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Upfront licensing and milestone payments expensed to research and development were $347 million in 2009 primarily attributed to ZymoGenetics, Alder and Nissan; $348 million in 2008 primarily attributed to Exelixis, PDL BioPharma, Inc. and KAI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and $162 million in 2007 primarily attributed to Exelixis, Pfizer, Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus) and Isis Pharmaceuticals. The 2009 acquisition of Medarex resulted in $40 million of additional spend. Acquired in process research and development The charges related to the acquisition of Kosan Biosciences, Inc. (Kosan) in 2008 and the acquisition of Adnexus in 2007. In process research and development (IPRD) projects acquired in a business combination after January 1, 2009 are capitalized initially and considered indefinite lived assets. Provision for restructuring The changes in provision for restructuring were primarily attributable to the timing of the worldwide implementation of PTI. Litigation expense The 2009 expense was primarily due to a $125 million securities litigation settlement. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Equity in net income of affiliates Equity in net income of affiliates was primarily related to our international partnership with sanofi and varies based on international PLAVIX* net sales included within this partnership. The decrease in 2009 is attributed to the impact of an alternative salt form of clopidogrel and generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales commencing in 2009. This unfavorable trend in earnings is expected to continue in future periods as such generic products have been launched in over half of the EU countries since August 2008, with additional launches expected in future years. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. Gain on sale of ImClone shares The gain on sale of ImClone shares in 2008 was attributed to our receipt of approximately $1.0 billion in cash for the tendering of our investment in ImClone. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations for further detail. 50 Table of Contents Other (income)/expense Other (income)/expense include: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 184 $ 310 $ 422 Interest income (54 ) (130 ) (241 ) Gain on debt buyback and termination of interest rate swap agreements (7 ) (57 ) ARS impairment 305 275 Foreign exchange transaction losses/(gains) 2 (78 ) 11 Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets (360 ) (159 ) (282 ) Medarex acquisition (10 ) Net royalty income and amortization of upfront licensing and milestone payments received from alliance partners (148 ) (141 ) (104 ) Pension settlements/curtailments 43 8 6 Other (31 ) (36 ) (10 ) Other (income)/expense $ (381 ) $ 22 $ 77 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and amortization resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps during 2009 and 2008. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 and 2008 partially offset by higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Auction rate securities (ARS) impairment charges recognized in 2008 and 2007 were due to the severity and the duration of the decline in value, the future prospects of the issuers and our ability and intent to hold the securities to recover their value. The value of ARS at December 31, 2009 was $88 million. Any future declines in fair value will be considered other than temporary and therefore recognized in our results of operations. The impact of foreign exchange was mainly due to the sudden and dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2008. This generated significant gains on foreign currency dominated transactions recognized during 2008. To a lesser extent, earnings were impacted in all periods by foreign exchange hedges that were discontinued or did not qualify as cash flow hedges. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Financial Instruments. Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of mature brands, including businesses within Indonesia and Australia in 2009; a business in Egypt in 2008; and the sale of BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan, Asia (excluding China) and certain Oceanic countries in 2007. Net royalty and alliance partners activity includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront licensing and milestone payments related to our alliances. Pension settlements / curtailments were primarily attributed to amendments which will eliminate the crediting of future benefits related to service for U.S. pension plan participants effective January 1, 2010. These amendments resulted in a curtailment charge of $25 million during 2009. The remainder of the charges resulted from the high level of lump sum payments in certain plans which exceeded the threshold (sum of plan interest costs and service costs) that require settlement accounting, resulting in an acceleration of a portion of previously deferred actuarial losses. Although most of this activity was driven by PTI and certain divestitures, additional charges may be recognized in the future, particularly with the U.S. pension plans due to a lower threshold resulting from the elimination of service costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. Other includes gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment, and ConvaTec and Medical Imaging net transitional service fees. 51 Table of Contents Specified Items During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the following specified items affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein.

This information is intended to enhance an investors overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: charges related to implementation of the PTI; gains or losses from the purchase or sale of businesses, product lines or investments; discontinued operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront licensing and milestone payments for in licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval that are immediately expensed; IPRD charges prior to 2009; special initiative funding to the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation; and significant tax events. For a detailed listing of items that are excluded from the non GAAP earnings from continuing operations, see Specified Items above. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they will reoccur in future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Dollars in Millions, except per share data GAAP SpecifiedItems Non GAAP GAAP SpecifiedItems Non GAAP Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 3,239 $ 428 $ 3,667 $ 2,697 $ 278 $ 2,975 Contingently convertible debt interest expense and dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to unvested shares (17 ) (17 ) 3 3 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation $ 3,222 $ 428 $ 3,650 $ 2,700 $ 278 $ 2,978 Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 1,978 1,978 1,999 1,999 Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 1.63 $ 0.22 $ 1.85 $ 1.35 $ 0.14 $ 1.49 Segment Results Segment results are consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purpose of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods. Segment results exclude the impact of specified items which are significant and not indicative of current operating performance or ongoing results. The following table reconciles our segment results to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. Segment Results % Change % of Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs.2008 2008 vs.2007 2009 2008 2007 BioPharmaceuticals $ 4,492 $ 3,538 $ 2,234 27 % 58 % 24 % 20 % 14 % Specified items (633 ) (223 ) (836 ) Noncontrolling interest 1,743 1,461 1,125 19 % 30 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 5,602 $ 4,776 $ 2,523 17 % 89 % Earnings increased primarily due to increased net sales of various key products in 2009 and 2008; more favorable gross margins due to price increases, product mix and realized efficiencies from previous PTI initiatives and more efficient spending within marketing, selling and administrative expense, partially offset by increased investments within our research and development pipeline. The improved gross margin rate and efficiencies mentioned above resulted in an increase in segment results expressed as a percentage of net sales during the past two years. 54 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 21.1% in 2009, compared with 22.8% in 2008 and 18.7% in 2007. The effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to permanently reinvest the earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland offshore and the U.S. Federal research and development tax credit.
