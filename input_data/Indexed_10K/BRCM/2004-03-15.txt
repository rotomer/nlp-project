Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report and the Risk Factors section at the end of this Item 7, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Report, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock. Overview Broadcom Corporation is a leading provider of highly integrated semiconductor solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice, video and data services. We design, develop and supply complete system on a chip (SoC) solutions incorporating digital, analog and radio frequency (RF) technologies, as well as related hardware and software system level applications. Our diverse product portfolio addresses every major broadband communications market and includes solutions for digital cable and satellite set top boxes; high definition television (HDTV); cable and DSL modems and residential gateways; high speed transmission and switching for local, metropolitan, wide area and storage networking; home and wireless networking; cellular and terrestrial wireless communications; Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gateway and telephony systems; broadband network and security processors; and SystemI/O server solutions. Net Revenue. We sell our products to leading manufacturers of broadband communications equipment in each of our target markets. Because we leverage our technologies across different markets, certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several different markets. We utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products. Our net revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products. Such sales represented over 95% of our total net revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We generate the balance of our net revenue mainly from development agreements, software licenses and maintenance agreements, and system level reference designs. The vast majority of our sales occur through our direct sales force. However, we derived approximately 7.1%, 10.4% and 10.8% of our total net revenue from sales made through distributors in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The demand for our products has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets; the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory; our ability to specify, develop or acquire, complete, introduce, market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner; the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products; and the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets. For these and other reasons, our net revenue in 2003 and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue. From time to time, our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. We expect these fluctuations will continue. 20 Table of Contents Sales to our significant customers, including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors, as a percentage of net revenue were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Hewlett Packard(1) 15.4 % 14.8 % 14.1 % Dell 11.9 11.3 * Motorola * 12.1 18.2 Cisco(2) * 10.0 * Five largest customers as a group 51.6 52.3 54.9 * Less than 10% of net revenue. (1) Includes sales to Compaq, which was acquired by Hewlett Packard in May 2002, for all periods presented. (2) Includes sales to Linksys, which was acquired by Cisco in June 2003, for all periods presented. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2004 and for the foreseeable future. These customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period. Net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the United States as a percent of total net revenue was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Asia 19.6 % 20.5 % 15.1 % Europe 5.9 4.4 6.3 Other 0.3 0.4 1.9 25.8 % 25.3 % 23.3 % Such net revenue does not include revenue from products shipped to subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that have headquarters in the United States even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the United States. All of our revenue to date has been denominated in U.S. dollars. Gross Margin. Our gross margin has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our product mix and volumes of product sales; the position of our products in their respective life cycles; the effects of competition and competitive pricing strategies; manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies; fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly, packaging and testing costs, and overhead costs such as prototyping expenses; amortization of purchased intangible assets; stock based compensation expense; product warranty costs; provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; licensing and royalty arrangements; and the mix of product revenue and development revenue. Product Cycles. The cycle for test, evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months, with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development, selling, general and 21 Table of Contents administrative efforts, and investments in inventory, to the time we generate corresponding revenue, if any. We anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month. If anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our results of operations for that quarter, and potentially for future quarters, would be materially and adversely affected. Acquisition Strategy. A key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market, complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combination transactions, strategic relationships, capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets. In 2003, 2002 and 2001 we completed six acquisitions for original aggregate equity consideration of $1.214 billion and cash consideration of $5.9 million. In 2003 we acquired certain assets of Gadzoox Networks, Inc., a provider of open standards based storage networking technology. In 2002 we acquired Mobilink Telecom, Inc., a supplier of chipsets and reference designs for use in cellular phones, cellular modem cards and wireless PDAs. In 2001 we acquired Visiontech Ltd., a supplier of digital video/audio MPEG 2 compression and decompression chips; ServerWorks Corporation, a supplier of high performance system input/output integrated circuits for servers, workstations and storage platforms; KimaLink, a developer of integrated circuits for wireless data communications; and PortaTec Corporation, a developer of integrated solutions for smart mobile devices. Because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing as of their respective acquisition dates. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Enterprise Segments. We operate in one reportable operating segment, broadband communications. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, or SFAS 131, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements. Although we had four operating segments at December 31, 2003, under the aggregation criteria set forth in SFAS 131, we only operate in one reportable operating segment, broadband communications. Under SFAS 131, two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of SFAS 131, if the segments have similar economic characteristics, and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas: the nature of products and services; the nature of the production processes; the type or class of customer for their products and services; and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services. We meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons: the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments; the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard CMOS manufacturing process; the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer: manufacturers of broadband equipment, who incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products; and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors. Because we meet each of the criteria set forth above and each of our operating segments has similar economic characteristics, we aggregate our results of operations in one reportable operating segment. 22 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, restructuring costs and litigation and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue, Gross Margin, Accounts Receivable and Inventory. We recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) transfer of title has occurred, (iii) our price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. In addition, we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met. These criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment. However, a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. Product revenue on sales made through these distributors is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers. In addition, we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as competitive pricing programs and rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. Our products typically carry a one to three year warranty. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs could be required. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. The purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development, or IPR&D. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization, and the amount assigned to IPR&D is expensed immediately. If the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct, or if business conditions change, purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our stock, 23 Table of Contents (iii) another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or (iv) any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets used in operations, including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Strategic Investments. We have made strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. Strategic investments in which we hold less than a 20% voting interest and on which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The share prices of publicly traded securities have been volatile, and the value of non publicly traded securities is difficult to determine. We periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method and write down investments to their fair value, with a corresponding loss recorded in other income (expense), net, in the statement of operations, when we believe an other than temporary decline has occurred. When determining whether a decline is other than temporary, we examine: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of an investment has been lower than its carrying value; (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the investee such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investee; and (iii) our intent and ability to retain our investment in the investee for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We generally believe an other than temporary decline has occurred when the fair value of the investment is below the carrying value for two consecutive quarters, absent evidence to the contrary. Fair values for investments in public companies are determined using their quoted market prices. Fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following: (a) the values of recent rounds of financing, (b) pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information, and or (c) quoted market prices of comparable public companies. Although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of the non publicly traded securities that we hold, had there been an active market for the equity securities, the carrying values might have been materially different than the amounts reported. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in which we have made such investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying values of the investments that may not be reflected in the investments current carrying values, and could require future impairment charges. Deferred Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. As a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks, we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate. In the future, if we realize a deferred tax asset that carries a valuation allowance, we will record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization. Restructuring Charges. We have undertaken, and we may in the future undertake, significant restructuring initiatives, which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities and or facilities. We have had to record estimated expenses for lease cancellations, long term asset write downs, severance and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs. Given the significance, complexity, and the timing of the execution of such activities, we periodically reassess the estimates we made at the time 24 Table of Contents the original decisions were made. Through 2002 the accounting rules for restructuring costs and asset impairments required us to record provisions and charges when we had a formal and committed plan. In calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities, we had to estimate our future space requirements and the timing of exiting excess facilities and then estimate for each location the future lease and operating costs to be paid through the termination of the lease and the amount, if any, of sublease income. To form our estimates for these costs, we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site. Our assumptions on future space requirements, operating costs until termination and or offsetting sublease revenues may be incorrect, and our actual costs may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional costs or to reverse previously recorded liabilities. We periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives. Beginning in 2003 the accounting rules require us to record any future provisions and charges at fair value in the period in which they are incurred. As management continues to evaluate the business, there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or settlement payments. If that occurs, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and we may be required to make future royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins. In addition, if further information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable, and we can reasonably estimate a range of loss associated with such litigation, we would then record at least the minimum estimated liability. However the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional costs. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 52.2 55.8 58.0 Gross profit 47.8 44.2 42.0 Operating expense: Research and development(1) 27.0 42.6 46.4 Selling, general and administrative(1) 11.8 15.3 16.2 Stock based compensation 16.3 33.1 50.3 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 0.2 2.1 2.8 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 27.3 116.8 122.9 Stock option exchange 13.0 Settlement costs 12.1 0.3 0.3 Restructuring costs 0.2 11.1 3.6 Amortization of goodwill 78.3 In process research and development 11.4 Loss from operations (60.1 ) (177.1 ) (290.2 ) Interest income, net 0.4 1.1 2.4 Other income (expense), net 1.6 (3.0 ) (3.2 ) Loss before income taxes (58.1 ) (179.0 ) (291.0 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 1.5 27.5 (5.9 ) Net loss (59.6 )% (206.5 )% (285.1 )% (1) Excludes stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock option exchange expense. Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Net Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit The following table presents net revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Net revenue $ 1,610,095 100.0 % $ 1,082,948 100.0 % $ 527,147 48.7 % Cost of revenue 839,776 52.2 604,397 55.8 235,379 38.9 Gross profit $ 770,319 47.8 % $ 478,551 44.2 % $ 291,768 61.0 26 Table of Contents Net Revenue. Our revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products. Net revenue is revenue less provisions for returns and allowances. The following table presents the contribution to the increase in net revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 from each of our major target markets: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Enterprise networking $ 917,876 57.0 % $ 702,562 64.9 % $ 215,314 30.6 % Broadband communications 373,562 23.2 288,609 26.7 84,953 29.4 Mobile and wireless 318,657 19.8 91,777 8.4 226,880 247.2 Net revenue $ 1,610,095 100.0 % $ 1,082,948 100.0 % $ 527,147 48.7 The growth in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in volume shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets in 2003. Our enterprise networking products include Ethernet controllers, PHYs and switches, network processors, server chipsets, and security and storage products. Our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modem, cable TV set top box, direct broadcast satellite and DSL applications. Our mobile and wireless products include wireless LAN, cellular and Bluetooth solutions. We anticipate that total net revenue in the first quarter of 2004 will increase by approximately 16% to 18% over the fourth quarter 2003 level. We also expect the net revenue increase in the first quarter of 2004 will be distributed across all three of our major target markets. Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries, costs associated with assembly, packaging, test and quality assurance for semiconductor products, prototyping costs, amortization of purchased technology, and manufacturing overhead, including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, product warranty costs, provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and contracted development work. Gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue. The 2003 increase in absolute dollars for gross profit resulted primarily from the 48.7% growth in net revenue. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in 2003 resulted primarily from lower amortization of purchased intangible assets, lower stock based compensation expense and shifts in our product mix, offset in part by additional stock based compensation expense due to our stock option exchange. The following table presents details of non cash expenses for employees engaged in manufacturing operations for 2003 and 2002 that are included in cost of revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Stock based compensation expense $ 6,528 0.4 % $ 12,917 1.2 % $ (6,389 ) (49.5 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets 17,207 1.1 56,032 5.2 (38,825 ) (69.3 ) Stock option exchange expense 11,454 0.7 11,454 $ 35,189 2.2 % $ 68,949 6.4 % $ (33,760 ) (49.0 ) At December 31, 2003 the unamortized balance of deferred compensation was approximately $1.4 million, which will be amortized to cost of revenue through 2007. At December 31, 2003 the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets was approximately $6.7 million, all of which will be amortized to cost of revenue in 2004. 27 Table of Contents Gross profit has been and will likely continue to be impacted in the future by competitive pricing strategies, fluctuations in the volume of our product sales, fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly, packaging and testing costs, product warranty costs, provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and possible future changes in product mix and the introduction of products with lower margins, among other factors. In addition, we anticipate that gross profit could continue to be impacted by amortization charges related to possible future acquisitions. Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table presents research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 434,018 27.0 % $ 461,804 42.6 % $ (27,786 ) (6.0 )% Selling, general and administrative 190,138 11.8 165,267 15.3 24,871 15.0 Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research, design and development activities, costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware, subcontracting costs, prototyping costs and facilities expenses. Research and development expense does not include amounts associated with stock based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for employees engaged in research and development or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development activities. The 2003 decrease in research and development expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a $14.0 million decrease in personnel related expenses and a $7.4 million decrease in prototyping costs due to our restructuring efforts. In addition, there were modest decreases in system level testing and costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware. Research and developments costs in 2003 reflected costs savings resulting from the restructuring plan we began implementing in the fourth quarter of 2002, or the 2002 Restructuring Plan, which included workforce reductions. This was partially offset by new hires in 2003 as well as a change in our employee compensation policies implemented in the second quarter of 2003 that resulted in an increase in cash compensation to certain employees. Savings from our 2002 Restructuring Plan will continue to be offset by any new hires in the future and any future acquisitions. In addition, based upon past experience, we anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars will increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve, new product opportunities, changes in our compensation policies and any expansion into new markets and technologies. We remain committed to a significant level of research and development effort to extend our technology leadership in the broadband communications markets in which we operate. We hold over 500 U.S. patents and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional patents in broadband communications and other fields. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses, legal and other professional fees, facilities expenses, communications expenses and trade show expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense does not include amounts associated with stock based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for administrative employees or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to selling, general and administrative activities. The 2003 increase in selling, general and administrative expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a $16.6 million increase in legal costs. In addition, there were modest increases in salaries and related costs, insurance costs and bad debt expense, offset in part by a decrease in information technology maintenance and supplies expense and expenditures for travel and entertainment. Based upon past experience, we anticipate that over the long term selling, general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase to 28 Table of Contents support any expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions, as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support any increased headcount, changes in our compensation policies, acquisition and integration activities, and international operations, and as a result of current and any future litigation to protect our business interests and intellectual property. Stock Based Compensation Expense The following table presents stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling, general and administrative activities for 2003 and 2002, all of which was excluded from those operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 219,337 13.6 % $ 252,365 23.3 % $ (33,028 ) (13.1 )% Selling, general and administrative 44,623 2.7 107,425 9.8 (62,802 ) (58.5 ) $ 263,960 16.3 % $ 359,790 33.1 % $ (95,830 ) (26.6 ) Stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation as well as expense related to options subject to variable accounting. Deferred compensation primarily represents the difference between the fair value of our Class A common stock at the measurement date of each acquisition and the original purchase price of the restricted stock or exercise price of the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition. Deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options, generally three to five years. Additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration is measured and recorded at the date the contingency is satisfied. Employee terminations in 2003 and 2002 resulted in the elimination of deferred compensation of approximately $30.1 million and $103.0 million, respectively, that is no longer amortized. We recorded approximately $60.5 million of net deferred compensation in 2003 primarily for contingent consideration earned in connection with our acquisitions of ServerWorks and Mobilink. We recorded approximately $2.2 million of deferred compensation in 2002 primarily for restricted stock assumed in our acquisition of Mobilink. The 2003 decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to the elimination of deferred compensation due to the termination of certain employees and certain assumed options being fully amortized, offset in part by the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense related to certain assumed stock options and additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration. At December 31, 2003 the unamortized balance of deferred compensation was approximately $76.2 million, which will be amortized to research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses through 2007. However, if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying restricted stock or unvested stock options, we may be required to either accelerate from future periods or cancel the remaining deferred compensation. In the event additional deferred compensation is recorded in connection with any future acquisitions, our operating expense would be impacted by its amortization. 29 Table of Contents Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development and selling, general and administrative activities for 2003 and 2002, all of which was excluded from those operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 815 0.0 % $ 19,566 1.8 % $ (18,751 ) (95.8 )% Selling, general and administrative 2,689 0.2 2,821 0.3 (132 ) (4.7 ) $ 3,504 0.2 % $ 22,387 2.1 % $ (18,883 ) (84.3 ) Purchased intangible assets primarily include completed technology, customer relationships, contracts and backlog, and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from less than one to three years. The 2003 decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets was primarily a result of certain purchased intangible assets being fully amortized. We currently have no remaining purchased intangible assets to amortize to future operating expense. However, if we acquire purchased intangible assets in the future, our operating expense would be impacted by the amortization of these assets. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 439,611 27.3 % $ 1,265,038 116.8 % $ (825,427 ) (65.2 )% We performed our annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with our various acquisitions required under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, in October 2003 and 2002. In addition, we determined that indicators of impairment existed for two of our reporting units in May 2003 and an additional impairment assessment was performed at that time. In accordance with SFAS 142, we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to their estimated fair values. At October 1, 2003 and 2002, we had four and seven reporting units, respectively. We determined and identified those reporting units in accordance with SFAS 142. We estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method, taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our Board of Directors. Cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Concepts Statement 7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements. Specifically, the income approach valuation used reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from 13% to 16%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 0% to 11%. Publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our 30 Table of Contents company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology. Upon completion of the October 2003 annual impairment assessment, we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair values of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. Upon completion of the October 2002 assessment, we determined that the carrying values of four of our seven reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values. The four affected reporting units were broadband processors, client server networking, mobile communications and ServerWorks. Because indicators of impairment existed for these four reporting units, we performed the second step of the test required under SFAS 142 to determine the fair value of the goodwill for each of the affected reporting units. In accordance with SFAS 142, the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as that which is utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. As part of the second step of the impairment test performed in 2002, we calculated the fair value of certain assets, including developed technology and in process research and development, or IPR&D, assets. To determine the implied value of goodwill, fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of each of the four affected reporting units in 2002. The implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the affected reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities. The impairment loss for each of the affected reporting units was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill. Based on this assessment, we recorded a charge of $1.241 billion in October 2002. Of such charge, $536.0 million related to the goodwill of our broadband processor reporting unit, $206.1 million related to the goodwill of our client server networking reporting unit, $179.6 million related to the goodwill of our mobile communications reporting unit and $319.3 million related to the goodwill of our ServerWorks reporting unit. The primary factors resulting in the 2002 impairment charge were: (i) the continued significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry, which affected both our operations at that time and our expectations with respect to future revenue, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our stock, and (iii) unfavorable revisions in revenue and cash flow expectations regarding certain of our acquired businesses. These acquired businesses were priced based on valuation multiples that were indicative of the value at which businesses were purchased and sold at that time, but were inflated relative to historical and subsequent standards. In the second and third quarters of 2002 demand for servers, WAN networking equipment, handheld devices and other products using our chips declined relative to the demand that was anticipated when certain of our purchase acquisitions were consummated. In addition, we recognized that a sustained decline in demand combined with an oversupply of these products resulted in increased price competition for certain chipsets, giving effect to shrinking profit margins and expected future cash flows for our four affected reporting units. In response to the existing market conditions, we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2002 that included significant headcount reductions, and we decreased our investment in certain target markets that were either performing below our expectations or had low near term growth potential. As a result, we revised our forecasts of future operating results, which were in turn used in calculating the estimated fair values of the reporting units. In May 2003 we determined there were indicators of impairment for two of our reporting units, ServerWorks and mobile communications. We tested the goodwill of these reporting units for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 as described above. Based on this assessment, we recorded a charge of $438.6 million in June 2003 to write down the value of goodwill associated with the reporting units. Of this charge, $414.5 million represented the balance of goodwill related to the ServerWorks reporting unit and $24.1 million represented the balance of goodwill related to the mobile communications reporting unit. With respect to the ServerWorks reporting unit, the primary factors that contributed to the impairment assessment were additional competitive pressures in the server market and recent design losses experienced by that reporting unit that were attributable, in part, to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor. Another factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former ServerWorks stockholders and employees (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of the competitive pressures 31 Table of Contents and design losses, we reduced our forecasts of future operating results for the ServerWorks reporting unit for periods beginning as early as the second quarter of 2004 with the expectation of future loss of market share for that business. These forecasts in turn formed the basis for estimating the fair value of the ServerWorks reporting unit as of June 2003. We are continuing to pursue strategies to reposition our ServerWorks business and develop alternative sources of revenue for that reporting unit. With respect to the mobile communications reporting unit, the primary factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former Mobilink shareholders and employees in May 2003 (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), after that reporting unit had already been written down to its implied fair value in October 2002. In December 2003 and 2002, we acquired over 150 patents related to various technologies, including among others, wireless networking topologies and protocols, dual mode wireless transceivers, power management in integrated circuits, Ethernet networking, personal video recording, and VoIP telephony, for an aggregate of $1.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The immediate purpose of these patent acquisitions was to assist us in the defense and settlement of ongoing and future lawsuits. As a result, we were unable to estimate any future cash flows from the patents. We also do not have any plans to resell the patents to a third party. Due to our intended use for these assets, we concluded that indicators of impairment existed upon acquisition of the patents because it appeared that the carrying amount of the patents might not be recoverable. Upon determining that indicators of impairment existed, we performed a recoverability test in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of long lived assets should include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The cash flows expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the patents are actually the cash savings resulting from reduced but undeterminable legal expenditures over the next several years. Due to the unpredictable nature of legal disputes, it is not possible to reasonably: (i) determine if our strategy with respect to the patents will be successful, (ii) forecast legal expenditures that would have been incurred if the patent portfolio was not acquired and (iii) forecast cash flows generated as a result of acquiring the patents. As a result, pursuant to SFAS 144 no reasonable analysis could be prepared to support future cash flows associated with the patents. Accordingly, the patents were determined to be fully impaired at their respective dates of acquisition. For further discussion of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Option Exchange Expense The following table presents stock option exchange expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling, general and administrative activities for 2003 and 2002, all of which was excluded from those operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase % Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 164,798 10.2 % $ % $ 164,798 % Selling, general and administrative 44,468 2.8 44,468 $ 209,266 13.0 % $ $ 209,266 On April 7, 2003 we commenced an offering to our employees to voluntarily exchange certain vested and unvested stock options. Under the program, employees holding options to purchase our Class A or Class B common stock were given the opportunity to exchange certain of their existing options, with exercise prices at or above $23.58 per share. Stock options to purchase an aggregate of 57,271,153 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $47.32 per share were eligible for tender at the commencement of the program, representing approximately 43.6% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date. 32 Table of Contents On May 5, 2003 the offer period ended and we accepted for exchange and cancellation vested eligible options to purchase 32,642,634 shares of Class A or Class B common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $48.59 per share. In exchange, we issued 8,574,033 fully vested, non forfeitable shares of our Class A common stock and recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately $162.3 million related to the issuance of such vested shares, based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on May 5, 2003 of $18.93 per share. The 8,574,033 shares were included in our calculation of net loss per share effective as of May 5, 2003. Additionally, on May 5, 2003 we accepted for exchange and cancellation unvested eligible options to purchase 20,086,234 shares of Class A or Class B common stock, with a weighted average exercise price of $50.93 per share. In exchange, new options to purchase 18,301,676 shares of our Class A common stock were issued on November 10, 2003. The terms and conditions of the new options, including the vesting schedules, were substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the options cancelled. The exercise price for the new options was $35.12 per share which was the last reported trading price of our Class A common stock on the grant date. At December 31, 2003 there were options to purchase 102,912,733 shares of Class A or Class B common stock outstanding. Eligible employees (members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in the offer) who participated in the offer received, in exchange for the cancellation of vested eligible options, an amount of consideration, represented by fully vested, non forfeitable common stock, equal to the number of shares underlying such vested eligible options, multiplied by the offered value (as determined under certain terms and conditions set forth in our offer), divided by the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the NASDAQ National Market on May 5, 2003. We concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 23 Issues Relating to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44, or EITF 00 23, as the offered value per vested option was at least equal to the fair value for each eligible option, as determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. In determining the fair value of the eligible options using the Black Scholes option pricing model, we primarily used the following assumptions: (i) an expected life of approximately four years; (ii) a volatility of 70.0% during that expected life; (iii) a risk free interest rate of 2.72%; and (iv) no dividends. The weighted average offered value per vested option share was $4.97. Certain of our employees held unvested eligible options that were previously assumed by us in connection with acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. We had recorded deferred compensation with respect to those options based upon the applicable stock market valuation at the time of acquisition. To the extent those employees tendered, and we accepted for exchange and cancellation, such assumed eligible options in exchange for new options, we were required to immediately accelerate the amortization of the remaining related deferred compensation previously recorded. Consequently, we recorded a non cash charge of approximately $55.6 million in May 2003, reflecting the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense. Variable accounting is not required under EITF 00 23 for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation, because: (i) the shares of Class A common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non forfeitable and (ii) the number of shares received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by the offered value per vested option, divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange. We further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of paragraph 45 of FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation An Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, or FIN 44, applied to the stock options surrendered for cancellation. If any stock options were granted to participants in the offer within the six months prior to or following May 5, 2003, those stock options would be subject to variable accounting. As a result of these provisions, variable accounting is required for options to purchase approximately 208,966 shares as of December 31, 2003. In 2003 we recorded approximately $3.5 million of stock based compensation expense related to the portion of these variable options that vested during the period. In addition to the non cash charges described above, we incurred certain associated employer payroll taxes and professional fees of approximately $2.8 million in connection with the offering. Employees were responsible 33 Table of Contents for satisfying their portion of the payroll taxes, either through direct cash payment to us or through the sale of a portion of their new shares. Settlement Costs The following table presents settlement costs for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Settlement costs $ 194,509 12.1 % $ 3,000 0.3 % $ 191,509 6,383 % In May 2003 we completed a management transition at our ServerWorks Corporation subsidiary and entered into a settlement agreement resolving various issues and disputes raised by certain employees and former securities holders of ServerWorks, including issues and disputes with three departing employees, relating to agreements entered into when we acquired ServerWorks in January 2001. In connection with the settlement, we incurred approximately $25.2 million in cash payments and expenses and recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately $88.1 million in May 2003, reflecting the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense, most of which was previously recorded as deferred compensation established upon the acquisition of ServerWorks (and based upon stock market valuations at the time of the acquisition). In August 2003 we agreed with Intel Corporation to settle all outstanding litigation between the companies as well as litigation involving our respective affiliates. In connection with the settlement agreement, we agreed to pay Intel $60.0 million, of which $30.0 million was paid in August 2003, and the remaining balance was paid in October 2003. In January 2004 we entered into a settlement and license agreement to settle certain disputes. In connection with the settlement, we recorded $14.8 million as a one time charge for the disputes and claims in December 2003 and also recorded an asset of $1.2 million pertaining to a related license agreement in January 2004. Under the agreement, we are required to pay $16.0 million in cash, $8.0 million of which was paid in January 2004, and the remainder of which will be paid in four equal installments of $2.0 million on the anniversary date of the settlement agreement over each of the next four years. The value of the license agreement will be amortized to cost of revenue over its estimated useful life. We recorded an additional $6.4 million and $3.0 million in settlement costs in 2003 and 2002, respectively, in connection with the settlement of other outstanding litigation and third party claims. For a more detailed discussion of our outstanding litigation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring Costs The following table presents restructuring costs for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Restructuring costs $ 2,932 0.2 % $ 119,680 11.1 % $ (116,748 ) (97.6 )% From the second quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2002, we implemented a plan, the 2001 Restructuring Plan, to restructure our operations in response to the challenging economic climate. As a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry, we announced an additional restructuring program, the 2002 Restructuring Plan, which we implemented from the fourth quarter of 2002 through the second quarter of 2003. The plans focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies, including workforce reductions and lease terminations. These restructuring plans resulted in certain business unit realignments, workforce reductions and 34 Table of Contents consolidation of excess facilities. Approximately 510 and 160 employees were terminated across all of our business functions and geographic regions in connection with the 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Plans, respectively. In addition, headcount was reduced through attrition and reductions in the number of temporary and contract workers we employed. Activity and liability balances related to the 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Plans were as follows: 2001 Restructuring Plan 2002 Restructuring Plan Consolidation Consolidation Workforce of Excess Workforce of Excess Reductions Facilities Reductions Facilities Total (In thousands) Charged to expense in 2001 $ 16,100 $ 18,181 $ $ $ 34,281 Non cash costs(1) (11,070 ) (1,638 ) (12,708 ) Cash payments(2) (4,906 ) (6,073 ) (10,979 ) Restructuring liabilities at December 31, 2001 124 10,470 10,594 Charged to expense in 2002 1,411 30,454 65,048 22,767 119,680 Liabilities assumed in acquisition (3) 6,815 6,815 Non cash costs(1) (135 ) (4,868 ) (46,821 ) (1,495 ) (53,319 ) Cash payments(2) (1,400 ) (6,502 ) (16,683 ) (3,494 ) (28,079 ) Restructuring liabilities at December 31, 2002 29,554 1,544 24,593 55,691 Charged to expense in 2003 2,932 2,932 Non cash costs(1) (972 ) (972 ) Cash payments(2) (11,195 ) (3,504 ) (5,778 ) (20,477 ) Restructuring liabilities at December 31, 2003 $ $ 18,359 $ $ 18,815 $ 37,174 (1) Non cash costs related to stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of certain terminated employees and the acceleration of the vesting period of certain options of certain terminated employees as required by their assumed option agreements, and the write off of leasehold improvements. (2) Cash payments relate to severance and fringe benefits, net lease payments on excess facilities, lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs. (3) Although not related to the 2002 or 2001 Restructuring Plans, we assumed additional liabilities of approximately $6.8 million in connection with the Mobilink acquisition for the consolidation of excess facilities, relating primarily to lease terminations, non cancelable lease costs and write offs of leasehold improvements. The liabilities related to the Mobilink acquisition have been classified as restructuring liabilities for presentation in the consolidated balance sheets. These restructuring charges are classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Certain of the restructuring charges were recorded in periods subsequent to the initial implementations of the 2001 and 2002 Restructuring Plans. These subsequent charges were primarily due to the inability to reasonably estimate those costs at the time of the initial implementations as we were still in the process of reviewing many of our facilities to determine where we could consolidate and which locations would no longer be required. We do not anticipate recording any additional charges under the 2001 and 2002 Restructuring Plans. The consolidation of excess facilities costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2010. The goal of our 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Plans was to reduce our research and development and selling, general and administrative operating expenses, but we cannot assure you that we will achieve future expense reductions and other benefits that we anticipated. Anticipated savings from reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been and may in the future be, mitigated by subsequent increases to headcount, changes in our employee compensation policies and subsequent facilities additions related to our operating requirements. 35 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses The following table presents other income and expenses for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Interest income, net $ 6,828 0.4 % $ 12,183 1.1 % $ (5,355 ) (44.0 )% Other income (expense), net 26,053 1.6 (32,750 ) (3.0 ) 58,803 179.6 Interest Income, Net. Interest income, net, reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, less interest accrued on our debt and capital lease obligations. The decrease in 2003 resulted primarily from a decline in interest rates, offset in part by a decline in interest expense on lower average debt balances. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment. In September 2003 we realized a gain from a strategic investment in the amount of $24.4 million. That investment was previously written down by $24.1 million in September 2002, representing an other than temporary decline in the value of that investment at the time, as described below. This gain was offset in part by losses recorded in the amount of $2.3 million, representing other than temporary declines in the value of other strategic investments. In 2002 we recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of approximately $37.8 million in two separate periods. We recorded a loss of approximately $4.1 million in February 2002, which was based on information that led us to believe that the investee was proceeding into either a major financial restructuring and/ or bankruptcy. This belief was based on our working knowledge of the investee, the fact that we had been solicited by the investee company for continued financings and the poor performance of venture technology investments in the geographical region. Previously, this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of $4.1 million in September 2001 based on a then recent round of financing. We also recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of $33.7 million in September 2002. Approximately $24.1 million related to a second privately held investment. Originally, this investment had high growth prospects and was proposed to be selected for a key customer design win. This key design win potentially would have generated hundreds of millions in revenue over the next several years and positioned the investee for either an initial public offering or as an acquisition target. Ultimately, the investee did not secure the key design win, and, accordingly, was forced to enter into discussions to obtain a subsequent round of financing at a lower valuation. Therefore, at September 30, 2002 we believed it was necessary to permanently reduce the carrying value of this investment to its respective fair value, based on the term sheet for the potential subsequent financing. In addition approximately $7.8 million in impairment losses was related to a third privately held investment. The impairment was caused by an impending financing that was offered at a price substantially lower than our previously reduced carrying value. Earlier, this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of $8.8 million in September 2001 based on a pricing model using historical financial information. In September 2002 we recorded an additional $1.8 million in impairment losses relating to other strategic investments using the same methodologies described above. The losses recorded in 2002 were offset in part by approximately $4.6 million in gains realized on sales of an investment in a publicly traded company. 36 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes for 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 25,127 1.5 % $ 297,594 27.5 % $ 272,467 91.6 % No income tax benefit has been recorded for domestic tax losses. Our income tax expense in 2003 and 2002 primarily represents taxes on certain foreign operations and increases in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS 109. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in accordance with SFAS 109. As a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in 2003 and 2002. Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Net Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit The following table presents net revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Net revenue $ 1,082,948 100.0 % $ 961,821 100.0 % $ 121,127 12.6 % Cost of revenue 604,397 55.8 557,733 58.0 46,664 8.4 Gross profit $ 478,551 44.2 % $ 404,088 42.0 % $ 74,463 18.4 Net Revenue. Net revenue was reduced by approximately $25.5 million in 2001 to account for the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements that we assumed in prior acquisitions. No comparable performance based warrants were earned in 2002, and there were no remaining outstanding performance based warrants at December 31, 2002. The following table presents the contribution to the overall growth in net revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 from each of our major target markets: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Enterprise networking $ 702,562 64.9 % $ 565,168 58.7 % $ 137,394 24.3 % Broadband communications 288,609 26.7 369,902 38.5 (81,293 ) (22.0 ) Mobile and wireless 91,777 8.4 26,751 2.8 65,026 243.1 Net revenue $ 1,082,948 100.0 % $ 961,821 100.0 % $ 121,127 12.6 Net revenue in 2002 and 2001 has been classified based on our 2003 target market structure. Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. The 2002 increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from increased volumes and improved yields, which reduced direct product costs, increased absorption 37 Table of Contents of fixed overhead costs as a result of the increased volumes, and lower stock based compensation expense, offset in part by competitive pricing strategies and amortization of purchased intangible assets. The following table presents details of non cash expenses for employees engaged in manufacturing operations for 2002 and 2001 that are included in cost of revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Stock based compensation expense $ 12,917 1.2 % $ 15,901 1.7 % $ (2,984 ) (18.8 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets 56,032 5.2 51,741 5.4 4,291 8.3 $ 68,949 6.4 % $ 67,642 7.1 % $ 1,307 1.9 Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table presents research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 461,804 42.6 % $ 446,648 46.4 % $ 15,156 3.4 % Selling, general and administrative 165,267 15.3 155,488 16.2 9,779 6.3 Research and Development Expense. The 2002 increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from the addition of personnel through our acquisition of Mobilink, certain strategic new hires, and investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, offset in part by cost reductions from the 2001 Restructuring Plan. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. The 2002 increase in selling, general and administrative expense in absolute dollars reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the addition of certain strategic new hires as well as increased facilities expenses and legal fees, offset in part by cost reductions from our 2001 Restructuring Plan. Stock Based Compensation Expense The following table presents stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling, general and administrative activities for 2002 and 2001, all of which was excluded from those operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 252,365 23.3 % $ 321,571 33.4 % $ (69,206 ) (21.5 )% Selling, general and administrative 107,425 9.8 162,468 16.9 (55,043 ) (33.9 ) $ 359,790 33.1 % $ 484,039 50.3 % $ (124,249 ) (25.7 ) 38 Table of Contents We recorded approximately $2.2 million of net deferred compensation in 2002 and $377.9 million of deferred compensation in 2001, primarily in connection with restricted stock and stock options assumed in our acquisitions. Approximately $103.0 million and $84.6 million of deferred compensation was eliminated due to employee terminations in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2002 decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to the elimination of deferred compensation due to the termination of certain employees and the decrease in our year end stock price, which is used to remeasure stock based compensation for options subject to variable accounting. Due to the decrease in our stock price in 2002, we recorded approximately $7.0 million in reversals of previously recorded stock based compensation expense related to stock options subject to variable accounting in accordance with FIN 44 and FIN 28 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, or FIN 28. In 2001 we recorded approximately $35.0 million in stock based compensation expense related to stock options subject to variable accounting in accordance with FIN 44 and FIN 28. These charges and reversals were based on the amount by which our Class A common stock closing price at the end of each quarterly reporting period, or at the date of exercise, if earlier, exceeded the exercise price. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development and selling, general and administrative activities for 2002 and 2001, all of which was excluded from those operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 19,566 1.8 % $ 26,314 2.7 % $ (6,748 ) (25.6 )% Selling, general and administrative 2,821 0.3 878 0.1 1,943 221.3 $ 22,387 2.1 % $ 27,192 2.8 % $ (4,805 ) (17.7 ) Purchased intangible assets primarily include completed technology and customer relationships, contracts and backlog, and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from one to three years. The 2002 decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets resulted primarily from the reclassification, as required by SFAS 142, of assembled workforce as goodwill, which is no longer being amortized, offset partially by the amortization of other purchased intangibles. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (In thousands, except percentages) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 1,265,038 116.8 % $ 1,181,649 122.9 % $ (83,389 ) (7.1 )% For impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002, see the comparable discussion included under the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 caption above. In January 2001 the average trading price of our Class A common stock was approximately $112 per share. In the ensuing three month period, our stock price declined to an average price of $37 per share in March 2001, 39 Table of Contents representing a 67% decline. Given the high volatility in market prices of Internet related, semiconductor and other high technology stocks in general, and in our Class A common stock in particular, it was unclear at that time whether the change in market price was due to a short term fluctuation or recognition of a new pricing threshold. In the next six month period, the average price for our Class A common stock in any given month fluctuated from approximately $26 to $40 per share. In September 2001 our management concluded that the decline in market value of our stock from January 2001 to March 2001 was a sustained decrease. Accordingly, in September 2001 we determined that an assessment of the goodwill arising from certain of our purchase transactions was warranted. The assessment was performed in accordance with the two step test prescribed by SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of, or SFAS 121. The first step involved a recoverability test to determine whether the sum of undiscounted future cash flows associated with certain acquired entities exceeded the carrying amounts of those respective entities assets. The cash flows were estimated over a four year period and represented the cash flows identifiable to the entity. The first step resulted in a failed recoverability test for goodwill directly related to the purchase transactions of Allayer Communications, Silicon Spice, Inc. and Newport Communications, Inc. Certain of the affected businesses operated in high risk, emerging markets in which there was no assurance of sustainable sales at the time acquisition decisions were made. Several factors contributed to the impairment charge, including: (i) declining semiconductor company stock valuations, (ii) lower than anticipated demand for certain products including metro class Ethernet networking, carrier class and optical transceivers and (iii) higher than expected research and development costs to launch products in the aforementioned markets. As a result, these factors diminished the cash flow that had been anticipated when certain purchase transactions were consummated. The second step of the impairment test entailed estimating the fair value of net assets for those acquired businesses that failed the recoverability test. Fair value was determined using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounting of future cash flows. The cash flow period used was five years, with a discount rate ranging from 33% to 40%, and estimated terminal values based on a terminal growth rate of 5%. The discount rate was based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. The assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows, including the discount rate and estimated terminal values, reflected managements best estimates. In accordance with SFAS 121, the goodwill impairment charge was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of net assets exceeded fair value. Based on this assessment, we recorded a charge of $1.182 billion to write down the value of goodwill associated with the affected purchase transactions. Of such charge, $96.7 million related to the goodwill associated with Allayer Communications, $599.6 million related to the goodwill associated with Newport Communications and $485.4 million related to the goodwill associated with Silicon Spice. Other Operating Expenses The following table presents other operating expenses for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Settlement costs $ 3,000 0.3 % $ 3,000 0.3 % $ % Restructuring costs 119,680 11.1 34,281 3.6 85,399 249.1 Amortization of goodwill 753,042 78.3 (753,042 ) In process research and development 109,710 11.4 (109,710 ) Restructuring Costs. For a detailed description of our restructuring activities in 2002 and 2001, see the comparable discussion included under the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 caption above. 40 Table of Contents Amortization of Goodwill. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquired company and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The significant decrease in the amortization of goodwill in 2002 resulted from the impact of adopting new accounting standards. In June 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, or SFAS 141, and SFAS 142, both effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under these rules, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS 142 was immediately applicable to any acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. As required by SFAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill of $2.254 billion beginning January 1, 2002. Included in this amount is $12.1 million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets, which was reclassified as goodwill effective January 1, 2002 as required by SFAS 142. In Process Research and Development. The amounts allocated to IPR&D were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed. There was no IPR&D recorded in connection with the acquisition completed in 2002. IPR&D totaled $109.7 million for the four purchase transactions completed in 2001. The fair value of IPR&D for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. Each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance upon core technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development. Future cash flows for each project were estimated based upon forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account product life cycles and market penetration and growth rates. The IPR&D charge includes only the fair value of IPR&D performed as of the acquisition date. The fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets, and future research and development is included in goodwill. We believe the amounts recorded as IPR&D, as well as developed technology, represent fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the time of the respective acquisitions. The following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations for our significant purchase transactions completed in 2001: Weighted Average Average Estimated Risk Estimated Estimated Cost to Adjusted Percent Time to Complete Discount IPR&D Purchase Transaction Development Projects Complete Complete (In millions) Rate (In millions) Visiontech Video compression integrated circuits 60% 1 year $ 5.2 30 35 % $ 30.4 ServerWorks High performance SystemI/O integrated circuits for servers 45% 1.5 years 21.2 29 34 % 79.3 We completed all of the Visiontech development projects as expected in 2001. ServerWorks completed two development projects in 2002. Approximately $8.0 million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects. ServerWorks reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that it believes are better aligned with future demand. Except as noted above, actual results to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions. The assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for 41 Table of Contents the in process projects, estimated costs to complete the projects, and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market. Failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may potentially result in impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets. Other Income and Expenses The following table presents other income and expenses for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Interest income, net $ 12,183 1.1 % $ 23,019 2.4 % $ (10,836 ) (47.1 )% Other income (expense), net (32,750 ) (3.0 ) (30,875 ) (3.2 ) 1,875 6.1 Interest Income, Net. The 2002 decrease resulted primarily from an overall decline in both our cash and marketable securities balances and the interest rates thereon. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net, primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment. For further discussion of our other than temporary declines in strategic investments recorded in 2002, see the comparable discussion included under the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 caption above. In 2001 we recorded other than temporary declines in strategic investments of $32.7 million. Included in this amount was approximately $22.0 million related to publicly traded companies and $10.7 million related to privately held companies, which are described in detail below. In September 2001 we recorded other than temporary losses of approximately $22.0 million related to securities associated with underlying shares of two publicly traded companies that were originally purchased in the fourth quarter of 2000. The fair values of these investments were determined using the quoted market prices of the underlying publicly traded shares in conjunction with other inputs used in standard valuation methodologies in certain cases where the securities did not have a liquid market. Prior to recording these losses, we calculated and recorded on a quarterly basis unrealized gains and losses as part of comprehensive income based on their respective quoted market prices. Prior to the third quarter of 2001, we determined that the decline in fair value for these investments was temporary and concluded that it was likely that we would be able to recover the carrying value of our investment in a reasonable time period. At the time, we relied, in part, on certain analysts reports regarding future prospects, target stock prices, and annualized stock price volatility in the two quarters leading up to the third quarter of 2001. In September 2001, we determined it was appropriate under guidance provided by the SEC in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, to record an other than temporary loss due to the sustained decline in value over the previous two consecutive quarters. Therefore we permanently reduced the carrying value of these investments to their respective fair values. The additional losses of approximately $10.7 million recorded in September 2001 were related to other than temporary declines in our privately held investments. We considered the losses relating to our publicly traded investments and determined these losses were indicators of potential impairment with respect to our privately held investments. Therefore we performed an evaluation of the fair value for all of our privately held investments to determine if other impairments existed. The fair values were estimated based upon one or more of the following: (i) the values of recent rounds or discussions of financing, (ii) pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information, and or (iii) quoted market prices of comparable public companies. Additionally, in one instance, a development partner cancelled a significant development project with one of our investees during the period and, as a result, we immediately impaired the entire investment of $4.5 million. Based on these valuations and other indicators of impairment, we permanently reduced the carrying value of these investments to their respective fair values. 42 Table of Contents Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes The following table presents provision (benefit) for income taxes for 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 297,594 27.5 % $ (56,729 ) (5.9 )% $ 354,323 624.6 % We recorded an income tax provision of approximately $297.6 million in 2002 and a tax benefit of approximately $56.7 million in 2001, which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately (15.3)% in 2002 and 2.0% in 2001. The federal statutory rate was 35% for both periods. The differences between our effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001 and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible IPR&D, amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related expenses from the 13 purchase transactions completed in 2002, 2001 and 2000, as well as increases in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS 109. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 we had recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the amounts of approximately $990.2 million and $375.1 million, respectively, reflecting an increase in the valuation allowance in 2002 of approximately $615.1 million. In 2002 we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate as a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks. Impact of Adoption of Accounting Standard In June 2001 the FASB issued SFAS 142. Under these rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. As required by SFAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill of approximately $2.254 billion beginning January 1, 2002, which included approximately $12.1 million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets, which was reclassified as goodwill effective January 1, 2002. The following table presents the impact of SFAS 142 on net loss and net loss per share had the standard been in effect for all periods presented: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands, except per share data) Net loss as reported $ (959,865 ) $ (2,236,576 ) $ (2,742,048 ) Adjustments: Amortization of goodwill 753,042 Amortization of assembled workforce previously classified as a purchased intangible asset 6,549 Income tax effect (5,893 ) Net adjustments 753,698 Net loss as adjusted $ (959,865 ) $ (2,236,576 ) $ (1,988,350 ) Net loss per share (basic and diluted) as reported $ (3.29 ) (8.35 ) $ (10.79 ) Net loss per share (basic and diluted) as adjusted $ (3.29 ) $ (8.35 ) $ (7.83 ) 43 Table of Contents Subsequent Events In January 2004 we completed the acquisition of RAIDCore, Inc., a developer of redundant array of inexpensive disks, or RAID, and virtualization software. In connection with the acquisition, we expect to pay approximately $16.5 million in cash, of which approximately $10.0 million was paid in January 2004. The remaining amount will be paid to the founders and employees of the company subject to a two to four year vesting period and will result in additional compensation expense over those respective periods. We will record a one time charge in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $2.3 million for purchased in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition. In January 2004 we acquired approximately 80 patents and patent applications related to the read channel and hard disk controller markets, for approximately $18.0 million. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the patents were determined to be fully impaired at the date of acquisition. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a similar discussion regarding the impairment of a patent portfolio. The impairment charge for the patent portfolio will be classified as an operating expense in the first quarter of 2004. In February 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 and an acquisition shelf registration statement on Form S 4 with the SEC. Once declared effective by the SEC, the universal shelf on Form S 3 will permit us to sell, in one or more public offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. The acquisition shelf registration statement on Form S 4 will, once declared effective by the SEC, enable us to issue up to 30 million shares of our Class A common stock in one or more acquisition transactions. These transactions may include the acquisition of assets, businesses or securities, whether by purchase, merger or any other form of business combination. We currently have no immediate plans to issue securities pursuant to either of these registration statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003 the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or FIN 46, which was amended in December 2003. FIN 46 requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests (primary beneficiary) in a variable interest entity, or VIE, to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures. A VIE is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties. Development stage entities that have sufficient equity invested to finance the activities they are currently engaged in and entities that are businesses, as defined in FIN 46, are not considered VIEs. The provisions of FIN 46 were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new VIEs created after January 31, 2003. For remaining arrangements entered into with VIEs created before January 31, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 are effective at the end of the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. We have completed a review of our investments in both non marketable and marketable equity securities as well as other arrangements to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any VIEs. Our review did not identify any VIEs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital and Cash and Marketable Securities on Hand. At December 31, 2003 we had $492.2 million in working capital, $606.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and $36.4 million in long term marketable securities. At December 31, 2002 we had $187.8 million in working capital, $502.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and $40.2 million in long term marketable securities. Our working capital increased in 2003 primarily due to cash proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan and the proceeds from sales of our strategic investments, offset in part by payments of certain debt obligations and settlement costs and other changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Cash Provided and Used in 2003 and 2002. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $558.7 million at December 31, 2003 from $389.6 million at December 31, 2002 as a result of cash provided by investing, operating and financing activities. 44 Table of Contents In 2003 our operating activities provided $30.6 million in cash. Although we had a net loss of $959.9 million and used cash of $95.0 million related to changes in net operating assets and liabilities, these amounts were more than offset by $1.085 billion in non cash items. Non cash items included in net loss include depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, stock option exchange expense, certain settlement costs, certain restructuring charges, gains and losses on strategic investments and development revenue. In 2002 our operating activities used $69.2 million in cash. This was a result of our net loss of $2.237 billion, which was offset in part by $2.152 billion in non cash items and $15.0 million in cash provided by changes in net operating assets and liabilities. Non cash items included in net loss in 2002 included impairment of goodwill, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, certain restructuring charges, valuation allowance on deferred taxes, and net losses on strategic investments. Accounts receivable increased $91.9 million to $220.1 million in 2003. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the $183.2 million increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $479.1 million, as compared with $295.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Due to the nature of our business, we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable. We typically bill customers on an open account basis with our standard net thirty day payment terms. If our revenue continues to increase as it has in the most recent past, it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase. Our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers. Inventories increased $58.0 million to $104.0 million in 2003 primarily due to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers and also based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products. In the future, our inventory levels will be determined based on these factors as well as the product life cycle stage of our products and competitive situations in the marketplace. Such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels. Investing activities provided cash of $42.5 million in 2003, which was primarily the result of $69.7 million in net proceeds received from the maturities of marketable securities and $29.2 million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments, offset in part by the purchase of $47.9 million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of $5.9 million in net assets of a business. Investing activities provided cash in the amount of $22.4 million in 2002, which was primarily the result of $100.0 million in net proceeds received from the maturities of marketable securities and the sales of strategic investments, offset in part by the purchase of $75.2 million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of $3.3 million of strategic investments. Our financing activities provided $96.0 million in cash in 2003, which was primarily the result of $207.5 million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, offset in part by $113.5 million in repayment of debts and other obligations. Cash provided by financing activities was $32.5 million in 2002, which was primarily the result of $44.1 million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $13.7 million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations. Due to the increase in our stock price, a greater number of employees exercised their options and we received more proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2003 than we did in 2002. In the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past. 45 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003: Payment Obligations by Year (In thousands) There 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 after Total Operating leases $ 77,997 $ 68,002 $ 27,915 $ 25,595 $ 26,214 $ 43,464 $ 269,187 Purchase obligations 181,912 181,912 Restructuring liabilities 12,933 7,120 5,095 4,301 3,009 4,716 37,174 Settlement payments 8,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 16,000 Total $ 280,842 $ 77,122 $ 35,010 $ 31,896 $ 31,223 $ 48,180 $ 504,273 We lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2014. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments for silicon wafers, assembly and test services, lab test equipment, computer hardware, information systems infrastructure and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our restructuring liabilities consist primarily of estimated future lease and operating costs on restructured facilities, less offsetting sublease income, if any. These costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2010. These amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with a settlement and license agreement entered into in January 2004. These amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the purpose of this table, purchase obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, we have purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. Prospective Capital Needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated by operations and from the exercise of employee stock options, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. In February 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC that, when declared effective, will allow us to sell, in one or more public offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. However, we have no immediate plans to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. 46 Table of Contents Although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. We anticipate that the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans, and product and technology roadmaps; the market acceptance of our products; the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain; capital improvements to new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; the availability of sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; expenses related to our restructuring plans; the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts; the level of cash generated from the net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets, including the effects of recent international conflicts and the general economic slowdown and related uncertainties. In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. 47 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10 Q and 8 K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our Class A common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. Fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and those identified throughout this Risk Factors section: economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets; our ability to secure sufficient capacity at third party semiconductor foundries and sufficient packaging materials from the third party subcontractors who assemble and test substantially all of our products; the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory; the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets; our ability to retain, recruit and hire key executives, technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers, with the experience and capabilities, and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans; the gain or loss of a key customer, design win or order; the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products; changes in our product or customer mix; the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales; our ability to specify, develop or acquire, complete, introduce, market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner; fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our foundries, and other problems or delays in the fabrication, assembly, testing or delivery of our products; the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, international conflicts and other events beyond our control; and changes in accounting rules, such as the proposed change regarding recording expenses for employee stock options and other stock based compensation. We are beginning to derive a larger portion of our product revenue from our relatively newer markets such as the markets for wireless networking, DBS, cellular, DSL and PVR applications. We expect these product lines to account for a higher percentage of our sales in the future. These markets are immature and unpredictable, and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop into significant opportunities or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets. Based on the limited amount of historical data available to us, it is difficult to predict our future revenue streams from and the sustainability of such newer markets. Additionally, rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas also make it difficult for us to estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business. We believe that we may become subject to some seasonality in demand for our solutions that are designed for use in consumer products, such as desktop and 48 Table of Contents notebook computers, PDAs, other wireless enabled consumer electronics, and satellite and digital cable set top boxes, which may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Due to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this Report, you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of future performance. Continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. In the last three years worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity, concerns about inflation and deflation, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and broadband communications markets, the lingering effects of the war in Iraq, and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity. In addition, the lingering effects of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a recurrence of SARS or the outbreak of a new public health emergency could have a further adverse effect upon an already weakened world economy. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Although recently we have seen some signs of recovery in the worldwide economy, we cannot predict the timing, strength and duration of any economic recovery, worldwide or in the broadband communications markets. If the economy does not continue to recover, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. We operate primarily in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns. These downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventories, and accelerated erosion of prices. These factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue and in our results of operations. Any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of this industry or the broadband communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect our ability to ship products. Accordingly, our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry, which could cause our stock price to decline. If we fail to manage growth in our business effectively, we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. To achieve our business objectives, we anticipate that we will need to continue to expand. We have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion in the past. Through internal growth and acquisitions, we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce, from 1,069 employees as of December 31, 1999 to 2,774 employees as of December 31, 2003, including contract and temporary employees. This past growth has placed, and any future growth is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. Although we have recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to help us improve our planning and management processes, we anticipate that we will need to continue to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, such as a new material requirements planning, or MRP, system and a new human resources management, or HRM, system, as well as additional procedures and controls and other internal management systems. We also will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort. If we are unable to accomplish these endeavors in a timely manner, we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents We depend on six independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products, and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business. We do not own or operate a fabrication facility. Six outside foundry subcontractors located in Asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production. Availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand. In addition, a recurrence of SARS or the occurrence of another public health emergency in Asia could further affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures. If we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries, or in the event of a quarantine or closure at any of these foundries, our revenues, cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Additionally, in September 1999 two of our foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in Taiwan. As a consequence of this earthquake, they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries, which, together with strong demand, resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide. If any of our foundries experiences a shortage in capacity, or suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity, we may need to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner. Even our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process. We typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it. If we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner, we may experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products. Because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity, we face several significant risks, including: a lack of guaranteed wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices; limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs; and the unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies. In addition, the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. This often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies. Poor yields from our foundries could result in product shortages or delays in product shipments, which could seriously harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations. Although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers, we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a significant guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries. Foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand. We place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand, and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are, or that have long term agreements with our main foundries, may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. Although we use six independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products, most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time, and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries. Accordingly, if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed, we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components. Also, our third party foundries typically migrate capacity to newer, state of the art manufacturing processes on a regular basis, which may create capacity shortages for our products designed to be manufactured on an older process. We cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields, or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis, or at reasonable prices. These and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. 50 Table of Contents Although we may utilize new foundries for other products in the future, in using new foundries we will be subject to all of the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries. We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, our business could be seriously harmed. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments. Customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. We currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and they increasingly focus more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. In the recent past, our customers have begun requesting shipment of our products earlier than our normal lead times. To meet these shortened lead times, we must place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to or at all. As a result, we would hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations. Furthermore, we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer. If a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products, we could incur significant charges against our income. We depend on third party subcontractors to assemble, obtain packaging materials for, and test substantially all of our current products. If we lose the services of any of our subcontractors or if these subcontractors are unable to attain sufficient packaging materials, shipments of our products may be disrupted, which could harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales. We do not own or operate an assembly or test facility. Seven third party subcontractors located in Asia assemble, obtain packaging materials for, and test substantially all of our current products. Because we rely on third party subcontractors to perform these functions, we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance. This lack of control has in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of our products or increase our manufacturing, assembly or testing costs. In the recent past we and others in our industry experienced a shortage in the supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products. If our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner, we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments, which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales. We do not have long term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products. However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above. 51 Table of Contents We may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. To remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product by product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs, and we have designed most of our products to be manufactured in .25 micron, ..22 micron, .18 micron and .13 micron geometry processes. In the future, we expect to migrate some of our products to 90 nanometer process technology. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes. We are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate key senior management and technical personnel, which could seriously harm our business. Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, including our co founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Technical Officer, Henry Samueli, Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan E. Ross, and other senior executives. We do not have employment agreements with these executives, or any other key employees, that govern the length of their service. The loss of the services of Dr. Samueli, Mr. Ross or certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In January 2003 one of our co founders, Henry T. Nicholas III, Ph.D., resigned from his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer and decided not to stand for re election to our Board of Directors. Mr. Ross, who was serving as our Chief Operating Officer at the time of Dr. Nicholas resignation, assumed the responsibilities of President and Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors is continuing its efforts to identify a successor Chief Executive Officer. If we are unable to attract a suitable successor to Mr. Ross or if we lose the services of Mr. Ross prior to hiring his successor, our business could be seriously harmed. We anticipate that the recruitment of a successor Chief Executive Officer, and the adjustment to any changes implemented by such Chief Executive Officer, will continue to require substantial attention of our Board of Directors and management personnel. Additionally, the officers who serve as vice presidents of our business groups are not long time Broadcom employees, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them or that they will successfully implement our business plans within these business groups. Furthermore, our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel, particularly software engineers, digital circuit designers, RF and mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers. Competition for these employees is intense. Stock options generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees, and the substantial decline in the price of our Class A common stock over the past three years may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key employees. In April and May 2003 we conducted a stock option exchange offer for the purpose of improving our ability to retain key employees. However, we cannot be certain that the stock option exchange program will result in increased retention of those employees. 52 Table of Contents We have also modified our compensation policies by increasing cash compensation to certain employees. A continuation of this shift in our compensation policies is likely to lead to increased operating expenses. We cannot be certain that the changes in our cash compensation policies will improve our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. Our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our past workforce reductions could adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities. If we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new semiconductor solutions for existing and new markets, introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products. Our historical quarterly results have been, and we expect that our future results will continue to be, dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers. The development of new silicon devices is highly complex, and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products. Our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to: accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards; accurately define new products; timely complete and introduce new product designs; timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated; obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; achieve high manufacturing yields; shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration; and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products. In some of our businesses, our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully depends in part on access to information from companies that are competitors. If we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner, we will be unable to attract new customers or retain our existing customers as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our products into their product offerings or if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful. Our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage. As a result, we rely on equipment manufacturers to select our products to be designed into their products. Without these design wins, it becomes difficult to sell our products. We often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product. Additionally, in some instances, we are dependent on third parties to obtain or provide information that we need to achieve a design win. Some of these third parties may be competitors and, accordingly, may not supply this information to us on a timely basis, if at all. Once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitors product into its product offering, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the customer. Furthermore, even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering, we cannot be assured that its product will be commercially successful or that we will receive any revenue from that product. Sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products. Our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will continue to 53 Table of Contents achieve design wins or that our customers equipment incorporating our products will ever be commercially successful. We must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets to remain competitive. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries. Our past sales and profitability have resulted, to a large extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards. Our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. If new industry standards emerge, our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. In addition, our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation. A significant slowdown in any of these broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully. These rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards make it difficult to formulate a long term growth strategy because the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate. We have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected. If new markets do not develop as we anticipate, or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position. Our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes. We hold over 500 U.S. patents and have filed over 2,200 additional U.S. patent applications. We cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued. Even if a new patent is issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. If our patents do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. We may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. Moreover, because we have participated in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on the adopted standards. Certain Broadcom software (as well as that of our customers) may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties. Such open source software is often made available to us under licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, or GPL, which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the licenses customarily used to protect our intellectual property. In addition, there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of 54 Table of Contents certain of these licenses, including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be forced to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. Additionally, former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. As a result, our technologies and processes may be misappropriated, particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations, including product supply obligations, under those agreements, and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period. Moreover, we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs, and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization. We cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed. We are currently engaged in litigation, and we may have to engage in additional litigation in the future, to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This litigation has in the past been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, any litigation can divert managements attention from the operation of the business, which could negatively impact our operations. Third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties, and seriously harm our operating results. In addition, any litigation required to defend such claims against us could result in significant costs and diversion of management and personnel resources. Companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights. Moreover, in the past we have been engaged, and currently we are engaged, in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets. Although we are defending the pending litigation vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. In addition, we may be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents. An adverse determination in any of these types of claims could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products, could increase our costs of production and could expose us to significant liability. Any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in a patent or trade secret action, a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development. In addition, we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful. We may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another partys proprietary rights. Even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and 55 Table of Contents personnel resources to defend. Additionally, we have in the past sought and may in the future seek to obtain a license under a third partys intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant a license to certain of our intellectual property rights to a third party in connection with a cross license agreement or a settlement of claims or actions asserted against us. However, we may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain customers. If we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitors solutions instead of buying our products, our operating results would be adversely affected. In the past, we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets. We intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. These relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges. Our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules. Accordingly, we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships, which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects. Delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitors solution for products that they currently buy from us. If that happens, our sales would decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business. In addition, if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers, our future operating results could be adversely affected. We have derived a substantial portion of our revenue in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers. As a result, the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Sales to Hewlett Packard and Dell, including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors, accounted for approximately 15.4% and 11.9%, respectively, of our net revenue in 2003. Sales to our five largest customers, including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors, represented approximately 51.6% of our net revenue in 2003 as compared with 52.3% of our net revenue in 2002. We expect that a small group of key customers, the composition of which has varied over time, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in 2004 and in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities. We may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons, including the following: most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty; our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products; many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decisions to purchase our products; our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products; and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products. In addition, our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products. If these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers, we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements. In that event, our average selling 56 Table of Contents prices and gross margins would decline. The loss of a key customer, a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets, which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets. The semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets are intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets. We currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in the markets for digital cable and satellite set top boxes; HDTV; cable and DSL modems and residential gateways; high speed transmission and switching for local, metropolitan, wide area and storage networking; home and wireless networking; cellular and terrestrial wireless communications; VoIP gateway and telephony systems; broadband network and security processors; and system I/O server solutions. We also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than Broadcom. This competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for some of our products. In all of our target markets we also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers who choose to develop their own silicon solutions. We also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete. Many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets. In some of our businesses, we are dependent on competitors for information for the timely development of next generation products, and such information may not always be given to us on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors. If we do not compete successfully, we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline. Our acquisition strategy may be dilutive to existing shareholders, result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses. A key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. Between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2003 we acquired 22 companies and certain assets of one other business. We continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combination transactions, strategic partnerships, and the purchase or sale of assets, including tangible and intangible assets such as intellectual property. We also continually evaluate the performance and prospects of our various businesses and possible adjustments in our businesses to reflect changes in our assessment of their performance and prospects. Acquisitions may require significant capital infusions, typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies. We have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and 57 Table of Contents successful integration of an acquired companys technologies and product development through volume production, unanticipated costs and expenditures, changing relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic partners, or contractual, intellectual property or employment issues. In addition, key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us. The acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation and increase our expenses. These challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases. Furthermore, these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the typical size of the companies we have historically acquired. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and deferred compensation charges, and the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations. In connection with our 14 transactions in which we used the purchase method of accounting, we recorded goodwill in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.592 billion. Through 2001 the portion of that goodwill attributable to each acquisition generally was amortized over a 60 month period from the date that the acquisition closed. In accordance with SFAS 121, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.182 billion in the third quarter of 2001 to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions. Effective January 1, 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with SFAS 141 and SFAS 142. In accordance with SFAS 142 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $438.6 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $1.241 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002 to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions. We may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. In addition, in connection with these acquisitions we incurred deferred compensation charges generally related to the assumption of unvested stock options and restricted shares in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.653 billion, which is being amortized over the period during which the relevant options or restricted stock may continue to vest. We expect to record additional goodwill and deferred compensation in connection with future acquisitions. Any of these events could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. Acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves. Alternatively, we may issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition. In February 2004 we filed an acquisition shelf registration statement on Form S 4 with the SEC that, when declared effective, will enable us to issue up to 30 million shares of our Class A common stock in one or more acquisition transactions that we may make from time to time, although we have no immediate plans to issue common stock under the acquisition shelf registration statement. Any additional issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock. For example, as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests rules, the securities issued in nine of our prior acquisitions were shares of Class B common stock, which have voting rights superior to our publicly traded Class A common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms, as the decline in the price of our Class A common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses, assets, products, technologies or personnel, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by borrowing money, but additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated by operations and from the exercise of employee stock options will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, 58 Table of Contents capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. In February 2004 we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC that, when declared effective, will allow us to sell, in one or more public offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. However, we have no immediate plans to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A or Class B common stock. Our efforts to develop new revenue sources and replace lost revenue sources for our ServerWorks business may not be successful. Our ServerWorks business has recently experienced design losses that were attributable, in part, to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor. These design losses led us to reduce our forecasts of future operating results for this business for periods beginning as early as the second quarter of 2004, with the expectation of future loss of market share for this business. We are now pursuing strategies to reposition ServerWorks and to develop alternative sources of revenue for the business. We cannot assure you that these strategies will be successful. If they are not successful, or if revenues from our other businesses do not increase as expected, our revenue or revenue growth rate and results of operations may be adversely affected. As our international business expands, we are increasingly exposed to various legal, business, political and economic risks associated with our international operations. We currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the United States. In addition, approximately 25.8% of our net revenue in 2003 was derived from sales to independent customers outside the United States. (Such net revenue does not include revenue from products shipped to subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors that have headquarters in the United States even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the United States.) We also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. In 1999 we established an international distribution center in Singapore that includes an engineering design center. We also undertake design and development activities in Belgium, Canada, China, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad. The recent war in Iraq and the lingering effects of terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad, the resulting heightened security and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive. International operations are subject to many other inherent risks, including but not limited to: political, social and economic instability; exposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property; natural disasters and public health emergencies; nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows; trade and travel restrictions; the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions; burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; import and export license requirements and restrictions of the United States and each other country in which we operate; 59 Table of Contents unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; foreign technical standards; changes in tariffs; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition; and potentially adverse tax consequences. Any of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales. Additionally, our operations may be impacted by SARS related factors, including, but not limited to, disruptions at our third party manufacturers that are primarily located in Asia, reduced sales in our international retail channels and increased supply chain costs. If SARS recurs or spreads to other areas, or other similar public health emergencies arise, our international sales and operations could be harmed. We currently operate under tax holidays in certain foreign jurisdictions. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy such tax holidays or realize any net tax benefits from such tax holidays. Moreover, the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad. All of our international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies. We anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities. Our products typically have lengthy sales cycles. A customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans, which could cause us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, our average product life cycles tend to be short and, as a result, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our operating results. After we have developed and delivered a product to a customer, the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product. Our customers may need three to more than six months to test, evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than nine months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products. It is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures. Even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment, we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful. The delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans. Such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated. In addition, anticipated sales could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails, reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products. While our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us, and from time to time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory. If we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed. 60 Table of Contents The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs, which could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect the market acceptance of new products. Highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. We have recently experienced, and may in the future experience, these defects and bugs. If any of our products contains defects or bugs, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to our customers. To alleviate these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources. Although our products are tested by us and our suppliers and customers, it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs. If any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others. In addition, OEMs who purchase PC components may require that we assume liability for defects associated with products produced by their manufacturing subcontractors and require that we provide a warranty for defects or other problems which may arise at the system level. Moreover, we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products, and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers. Changes in the accounting treatment of stock options could adversely affect our results of operations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has announced its tentative decision to require companies to expense employee stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, or SFAS 123, for financial reporting purposes, effective in 2005. Such stock option expensing would require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option valuation formula, such as Black Scholes, and then amortize that value against our reported earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options. We currently account for stock based awards to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and have adopted the disclosure only alternative of SFAS 123. If we are required to expense employee stock options in the future, this change in accounting treatment would materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings. For an illustration of the effect of such a change on our recent results of operations, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We may experience difficulties in implementing or enhancing new information systems. We implemented a new ERP information system to manage our business operations in the second quarter of 2003 and are in the process of enhancing this new system. Although the transition has proceeded to date without material adverse effects, the possibility exists that our migration to the new ERP information system could adversely affect our disclosure controls and procedures or our operations in future periods. We also intend to implement a new MRP information system and a new HRM system and the migration to these new systems could also disrupt our operations. The process of implementing new information systems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: accept and process customer orders, receive inventory and ship products, invoice and collect receivables, place purchase orders and pay invoices, and all other business transactions related to the finance, order entry, purchasing, supply chain and human resource processes within the new ERP, MRP or HRM systems. Any such disruption could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our Class A common stock. Three of the six primary independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products and our California facilities are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Two of the six outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices are located in Taiwan and one such outside foundry is located in Japan. Both Taiwan and Japan have 61 Table of Contents experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes. Any earthquake or other natural disaster in Taiwan or Japan could significantly disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery, or substantial shortage, of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices. Our California facilities, including our principal executive offices, are located near major earthquake fault lines. If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located, it could significantly disrupt our operations. Changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the FCC, other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business. The Federal Communications Commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets. Although current FCC regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products, they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated. FCC regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products. Accordingly, the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may, in turn, materially and adversely impact our business. For example, in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with FCC emissions specifications. We and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the United States. Foreign governments may impose tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These tariffs, duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business. Our stock price is highly volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them. The market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Since January 1, 2002 our Class A common stock has traded at prices as low as $9.52 and as high as $53.35 per share. These fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including: quarter to quarter variations in our operating results; announcements of changes in our senior management; the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers; announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers or us; the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets; general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets; continuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism; changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts; changes in investor perceptions; changes in accounting rules, particularly those related to the expensing of stock options; or changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers. In addition, the market prices of securities of Internet related, semiconductor and other technology companies have been especially volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation, and as noted in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits, which have been consolidated into a single action. We and certain of our directors and officers have also been sued in purported shareholder 62 Table of Contents derivative actions and other securities litigation. Although we believe that those lawsuits are without merit, an adverse determination could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations, and could materially affect the price of our stock. Moreover, regardless of the ultimate result, it is likely that the lawsuits will divert managements attention and resources from other matters, which could also adversely affect the price of our stock. Our co founders, directors, executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders, and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval. As of December 31, 2003 our co founders, directors, executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 20.7% of our outstanding common stock and held 67.3% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. Accordingly, these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders. These matters include the election of our Board of Directors, the issuance of additional shares of Class B common stock, and the approval of most significant corporate transactions, including a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. In particular, as of December 31, 2003 our two founders, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, who is no longer an officer or director of the company, and Dr. Henry Samueli, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Technical Officer, beneficially owned a total of approximately 19.5% of our outstanding common stock and held 65.9% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. Because of their significant voting stock ownership, we will not be able to engage in certain transactions, and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions without the approval of one or both of these shareholders. These actions and transactions include changes in control of our Board of Directors, mergers, and the sale of control of our company by means of a tender offer or otherwise, open market purchases or other purchases of our Class A common stock. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of Class B common stock in connection with certain acquisitions, upon exercise of certain stock options, and for other purposes. Class B shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote (as compared with one vote per share in the case of our Class A common stock). Our Board of Directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote. It is possible that the provisions in our charter documents, the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our Class B common stock, our co founders, directors and officers ownership of a majority of the Class B common stock, and the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of Class B common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our Class A common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock. These factors may also materially and adversely affect voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock and the market price of our Class A common stock. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. We do not use derivative financial instruments. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. Our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2003 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. Our marketable debt securities, consisting of commercial paper, corporate and foreign notes and bonds, and U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost, adjusted 63 Table of Contents for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity. Our investment policy for marketable debt securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less, with a weighted average maturity of no longer than one year. As of December 31, 2003 the carrying value and fair value of these securities were approximately $148.0 million and $148.3 million, respectively. These securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Our strategic equity investments are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for our publicly traded investments. We have also invested in privately held companies, the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage, or in funds that invest in such companies. We make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish important strategic relationships, expand existing relationships and achieve a return on our investment. These investments are inherently risky, as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. We realized a gain on the sale of one of our investments in a privately held company of approximately $24.4 million in September 2003. This investment was previously written down by approximately $24.1 million in September 2002, representing at the time an other than temporary decline in the value of this security investment. In September 2003 we performed impairment analyses and recorded impairment charges for certain of our strategic investments in privately held companies in the amount of approximately $2.3 million, representing other than temporary declines in the value of these investments. In 2002 we recorded a net gain of approximately $4.1 million primarily due to the sale of one of our publicly traded investments and recorded losses of approximately $37.3 million related to additional strategic investments. As of December 31, 2003 the carrying and fair value of our strategic investments was approximately $2.8 million. The fair value of our marketable debt securities fluctuates based on changes in interest rates; however, given the short term maturities, we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant interest rate risk. The carrying amount, principal maturity and estimated fair value of our marketable debt securities and long term debt exposure as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were as follows: Carrying Maturity Fair Amount Value 12/31/03 2004 2005 2006 12/31/03 (In thousands, except interest rates) Investments Cash equivalents $ 64,299 $ 64,299 $ $ $ 64,299 Weighted average interest rate 1.15 % 1.15 % Marketable debt securities $ 83,701 $ 47,296 $ 17,273 $ 19,132 $ 84,050 Weighted average interest rate 2.20 % 2.08 % 2.26 % 2.46 % Carrying Maturity Fair Amount Value 12/31/02 2003 2004 2005 12/31/02 (In thousands, except interest rates) Investments Cash equivalents $ 5,531 $ 5,531 $ $ $ 5,531 Weighted average interest rate 1.38 % 1.38 % Marketable debt securities $ 61,098 $ 56,031 $ 5,067 $ $ 61,419 Weighted average interest rate 4.54 % 4.71 % 2.71 % Restricted marketable debt securities $ 92,254 $ 57,117 $ 29,384 $ 5,753 $ 93,415 Weighted average interest rate 3.47 % 3.99 % 2.53 % 3.05 % Long term debt Capital leases and other obligations $ 5,870 $ 4,658 $ 1,212 $ $ 5,870 Weighted average interest rate 5.31 % 4.66 % 7.80 % 64 Table of Contents
