Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report and the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Report, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Report, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock. Purpose of this Amended Annual Report on Form 10 K/A We recently completed a voluntary review of our equity award practices. The voluntary review, which commenced in May 2006 and covered all grants of options and other equity awards made since our initial public offering in April 1998, was directed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The voluntary review consisted of two components: (1) an equity award review to determine whether we used appropriate measurement dates for option grants and other equity awards made under our extensive employee equity award programs, which was conducted with the assistance of outside legal counsel Irell & Manella LLP and forensic accountants FTI Consulting Inc., and (2) an investigation of the conduct and performance of Broadcoms officers, employees and directors who were involved in the stock option granting process, which was conducted with the assistance of independent legal counsel Kaye Scholer LLP and forensic accountants LECG, LLC. Based on the results of the equity award review, the Audit Committee concluded that, pursuant to APB 25 and related interpretations, the accounting measurement dates for most of the stock option grants awarded between June 1998 and May 2003, covering options to purchase 232.9 million shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, differed from the measurement dates previously used for such awards. As a result, revised measurement dates were applied to the affected option grants and Broadcom has recorded a total of $2.259 billion in additional stock based compensation expense for the years 1998 through 2005. After related tax adjustments of $38.7 million, the restatement resulted in total net adjustments of $2.220 billion for the years 1998 through 2005. This amount is net of forfeitures related to employee terminations. The additional stock based compensation expense is being amortized over the service period relating to each option, typically four years, with approximately 95% of the expense being recorded in years prior to 2004. As a consequence of these adjustments, our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three years ended December 31, 2005 and our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheet data for the five years ended December 31, 2005, included in Selected Consolidated Financial Data in Part II, Item 6 of this Report, have been restated. In addition, the unaudited quarterly financial information for interim periods of 2005 and 2004, included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been restated. We have also restated the stock based compensation expense footnote information calculated under SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, under the disclosure only alternatives of those pronouncements for the years 2003 through 2005 and for the interim periods of 2005 and 2004. The restated footnote information has been included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 15 of this Report. The adjustments did not affect Broadcoms previously reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods. Share and per share information presented in this Report has been adjusted to reflect all splits and dividends of our common stock subsequent to April 16, 1998, including the three for two stock split effected February 21, 2006 through the payment of a stock dividend. 56 Table of Contents Findings of the Equity Award Review From our initial public offering through May 2003, Broadcoms option grant processes and procedures were not formalized or consistently followed. During this period, option grants awarded to employees who were not then Section 16 Officers were approved by our Equity Award Committee (then known as the Option Committee). The committee consisted of two directors who were also Section 16 Officers, pursuant to authority delegated by the Board of Directors under the 1998 Plan and our 1999 Special Stock Option Plan. The Equity Award Committee did not conduct formal meetings with respect to all option grants; rather, the committee members often held informal discussions, either in person or telephonically, to determine whether option grants should be approved and priced as of that day. The Equity Award Committee members conferred frequently (often weekly) during 1998 and 1999. From 2000 through 2002, the Equity Award Committee members conferred less frequently and sometimes made option grants only once a quarter. No formal, contemporaneous written records of the Equity Award Committee discussions or meetings were kept. Instead, the Equity Award Committee relied upon, and option grant approvals were documented by, unanimous written consents, which were dated as of a specified date but were generally prepared after that date and signed at a later time. Thus, Broadcom has been unable to locate affirmative, contemporaneous documentation of Equity Award Committee meetings related to many past option grants. During the equity award review, we determined that 18 grant dates were selected after the as of date indicated on the unanimous written consents documenting the approvals for some or all of the options granted. Accordingly, during the equity award review process, we presumed that each of the 96 grant dates from our initial public offering through May 2003 did not meet the measurement date criteria of APB 25 unless we could locate contemporaneous documentation confirming both that (1) a meeting occurred on a specified grant date and (2) the identification of employee recipients and grant amounts were finalized by that grant date. Because we applied this presumption, a significant portion of the restatement adjustments are based upon our inability to locate such documentation. During the same period, from our initial public offering through May 2003, option grants to Section 16 Officers and members of the Board of Directors were approved by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee or made pursuant to the Automatic Director Grant Program under the 1998 Plan. Like the Equity Award Committee, the Compensation Committee relied upon, and option grant approvals were documented by, unanimous written consents, which were dated as of a specified date but were generally prepared after that date and signed at a later time. We have been unable to locate affirmative, contemporaneous documentation of Compensation Committee meetings related to several Section 16 Officer option grants. At the time of two grant dates to Section 16 Officers, a vacancy on the Compensation Committee existed; however, the vacancy had been formally filled by the time the unanimous written consents were executed by the committee members. Most grants to directors were made automatically on the dates specified under the 1998 Plan. None of the grants requiring measurement date adjustments was made to our co founders or any current or former member of our Board of Directors. In June 2003 we implemented revisions to our stock option grant processes and procedures. As a result, the processes were formalized and a consistent procedure was implemented for the Equity Award and Compensation Committees. In addition, the composition of the Equity Award Committee was changed to include an independent director. Our review of the equity award practices in effect since June 2003 has determined that our equity granting processes and practices are sound and have been consistently adhered to, and we have not identified any instances of inappropriate measurement dates under APB 25 for option grants or other equity awards made since May 2003. Currently, the Compensation Committee and Equity Award Committee each hold monthly equity award meetings based upon a predetermined schedule. The process requires that any proposed equity awards be reviewed in advance by both our Shareholder Services and Human Resources Departments, and requires communication of the details of proposed equity awards to committee members prior to each monthly meeting, as well as to award recipients promptly after the meeting. Equity awards are priced and valued based upon the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of the meeting. Decisions of each committee meeting are documented by minutes. 57 Table of Contents Adjustments to Measurement Dates During the course of the equity award review, we identified three reasons that led to the determination that 81 grant dates failed to meet the measurement date criteria of APB 25. None of the grants requiring measurement date adjustments was made to our co founders or any current or former member of our Board of Directors. For some of the 81 grant dates, more than one reason applied; as a result, the grant date numbers detailed below will not total 81 grant dates. The three reasons are: No Contemporaneous Documentation. The review identified 68 grant dates for which Broadcom has been unable to locate contemporaneous documentation (beyond the as of dated unanimous written consents) confirming that a committee meeting occurred on the indicated grant date. We presumed that each grant date did not meet the measurement date criteria of APB 25 unless we could locate contemporaneous documentation confirming both that (1) a meeting occurred on the grant date and (2) the identification of employee recipients and grant amounts were finalized by the grant date. The affected awards on these 68 grant dates involved 10,529 option grants covering 108.9 million shares. Of the options to purchase 108.9 million shares, options to purchase 0.4 million shares were granted to Section 16 Officers and options to purchase 108.5 million shares were granted to other employees. Among the 68 grant dates were three grant dates on which options were granted at times when the closing price of our Class A common stock was at or near the lowest price experienced during the applicable quarter or year. The three grant dates involved 1,128 option grants covering 12.5 million shares, none of which were granted to Section 16 Officers. Adjustments to the APB 25 measurement dates for the grants covered by the 68 grant dates resulted in the recording of additional deferred compensation of $1.037 billion. Date Selection. For 18 grant dates, the review identified documents and or unusual pricing procedures that indicated that the grant date for some options was selected after the date indicated on the unanimous written consent documenting the approval of those options. The affected awards on these 18 grant dates involved 6,205 option grants covering 90.3 million shares. Of the options to purchase 90.3 million shares, options to purchase 5.1 million shares were granted to Section 16 Officers and options to purchase 85.2 million shares were granted to other employees. Adjustments to the APB 25 measurement dates for these grants resulted in the recording of additional deferred compensation of $904.5 million. Subsequent Allocation. In 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002, we made large, broad based grants of options to a substantial percentage (as high as 90%) of our employees. With respect to two of the broad based grant dates, the review determined that we had not completed allocations of options to individual employees by the time the grant date was selected by the Equity Award or Compensation Committee. The affected awards on these two grant dates involved 4,271 option grants covering 33.7 million shares. Of the options to purchase 33.7 million shares, options to purchase 0.8 million shares were granted to Section 16 Officers and options to purchase 32.9 million shares were granted to other employees. Adjustments to the APB 25 measurement dates for these grants resulted in the recording of additional deferred compensation of $677.8 million. The equity award review also revealed that, with respect to 14 of the grant dates discussed above, the Equity Award Committee awarded options but we intentionally did not notify some of the employee recipients of their option grants for extended periods. We believe that notification is not an explicit criterion required by APB 25 to establish a measurement date. However, SFAS 123, if applicable, requires that there be a mutual understanding between the company and employee recipient of the terms and conditions of option awards for there to be a grant date, and APB 25 indicates that the measurement date generally is on or after the grant date. Accordingly, we decided that for these 14 grant dates, the date of notification to the affected employees represented the best approximation of the appropriate measurement date under APB 25. The affected awards on these 14 grant dates involved 608 option grants covering 13.1 million shares. Of the options to purchase 13.1 million shares, options to purchase 1.3 million shares were granted to Section 16 Officers and options to purchase 11.8 million shares were granted to other employees. Adjustments to the APB 25 measurement dates for these grants resulted in the recording of deferred compensation of $251.1 million, included in the amounts above. 58 Table of Contents Other Adjustments In addition, during the course of the equity award review, we identified some instances in which adjustments to deferred compensation were required that were not related to changes in measurement dates, as follows: Grants made to some consultants were erroneously accounted for under APB 25 as if they had been made to employees. To correctly account for these grants in accordance with SFAS 123, we recorded $33.8 million in additional deferred compensation during 1998 through 2002. Some grants were made to employees upon acceptance of their employment offers at Broadcom rather than as of or after the actual commencement of employment. To correctly account for these grants in accordance with APB 25 and SFAS 123, we recorded $12.1 million in additional deferred compensation during 1998 through 2002. With respect to 17 option grants, modifications were made to employee stock options that were not accounted for in accordance with APB 25. The modifications included the acceleration of the vesting period of options of terminated employees or the extension of the post service exercise period for vested stock options of terminated employees. We recorded $9.5 million in additional deferred compensation, principally in 2001 through 2003, to properly account for these modifications. In addition, other stock based compensation expense previously recorded in prior periods was adjusted in connection with the restatement. In connection with the termination of some employees, we recorded stock based compensation expense resulting from the extension of the post service exercise period for vested stock options and for acceleration of the vesting period of stock options. These modifications were accounted for correctly pursuant to APB 25. However, as a result of other adjustments made in our restatement, the previously recorded deferred compensation was reduced by $3.1 million. Related Tax Adjustments In our restatements for 1998, 1999, and 2000 we recorded income tax benefits of $3.7 million, $26.7 million, and $167.8 million, respectively, with respect to additional stock based compensation expense relating to U.S. based income. At December 31, 2000 we had additional deferred tax assets of $174.1 million for additional stock based compensation expense related to outstanding and unexercised stock options because we believed such amounts would more likely than not be realized given our expected future income from ordinary and recurring operations and tax planning strategies. No tax benefits were recorded for additional stock based compensation expense recorded during 2001 as such amounts were offset by a valuation allowance because we did not believe such additional deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2002 we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was appropriate as a result of our cumulative losses as of December 31, 2002, which caused a presumption that any deferred tax assets would be difficult to realize, and reversed the $174.1 million recorded in 2000, thereby increasing our 2002 income tax expense by $174.1 million and eliminating all previously recorded deferred tax assets. We recorded an income tax benefit of $19.5 million in 2004 related to income tax benefits realized from employee stock option exercises in 2004 that reduced our tax liabilities. Prior to the restatement, such income tax benefits were credited to additional paid in capital because there was no associated stock based compensation expense related to such employee stock options. No income tax benefits were recorded for additional stock based compensation in 2003 and 2005 because of our domestic tax losses prior to deductions related to employee stock options. As a result, the cumulative net income tax benefit we recorded through December 31, 2005 was $43.5 million. We also recorded other non income tax adjustments of $4.9 million, resulting in total related tax adjustments of $38.7 million. Financial Impact of the Equity Award Review The $2.672 billion total of the amounts shown above represents the aggregate gross additional deferred compensation that we recorded for the years 1998 through 2005 as a result of our equity award review. This amount does not reflect the elimination of $396.4 million in deferred compensation due to subsequent forfeitures related to employee terminations. In addition, the remaining amount of deferred compensation totaling $16.1 million at December 31, 2005 was eliminated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which we adopted 59 Table of Contents effective January 1, 2006. After such reductions, we recorded net additional stock based compensation expense of $2.259 billion for the years 1998 through 2005 in connection with our equity award review. After related tax adjustments of $38.7 million, the restatement resulted in total net adjustments of $2.220 billion for the years 1998 through 2005. The adjustments did not affect Broadcoms previously reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods. Findings of the Conduct Review In late July 2006, on the basis of its initial review, the Audit Committee decided to investigate the conduct and performance of Broadcoms officers, employees and directors who were involved in the stock option granting process. That investigation is referred to in this Report as the conduct review. During the four and a half month conduct review, the Audit Committee met 28 times. Its independent counsel reviewed more than six million pages of documents and electronic information, and interviewed more than forty individuals, some more than once. The conduct review was accomplished with the full support and cooperation of Broadcoms management and employees. The Audit Committee determined that, after May 2003, Broadcom made significant corrective changes to its option granting and documentation processes. The measurement date for each grant made after May 2003 complied with prevailing accounting rules and is not subject to restatement. The Audit Committee found that Broadcoms current processes are appropriate, that effective controls are now in place, and that there is currently no known material weakness in Broadcoms option granting processes. For the period from June 1998 through May 2003, however, the Audit Committee found that Broadcoms informal option grant procedures and processes lacked adequate controls, and that its documentation and recordkeeping were insufficient to verify most of the original measurement dates. The Audit Committee found that, for numerous option grants made between November 3, 1998 and May 19, 2003, certain Broadcom executives and employees selected grant dates after the fact. The Audit Committee further found that, particularly with respect to annual broad based option grants, allocations of grants to some individuals occurred after the grant dates. The Audit Committee found that, reflecting the lack of adequate controls, there was, at times, uncertainty and confusion among certain individuals at Broadcom as to the rules relating to accounting for options, and certain individuals at Broadcom did not appreciate, or may not have appreciated, what the appropriate accounting rules were or whether appropriate accounting charges were or should have been taken. Option grants were documented by unanimous written consents with as of dates. These unanimous written consents were often prepared weeks or months after the fact, and, apparently, a number of the as of unanimous written consents were presented for signature at the same time. With respect to both the Equity Award Committee and the Compensation Committee, the Audit Committee found no evidence of any attempt to falsify execution dates of the as of unanimous written consents, or of any effort to assert that the date of actual execution of the as of unanimous written consents was on the grant date or measurement date. The Audit Committee determined that all options and other equity awards granted to Broadcoms co founders and all current and former members of the Board of Directors were properly granted. Based on the totality of the information available to it, the Audit Committee found that certain individuals were actively responsible for the lack of controls and the inappropriate grant practices. With respect to these individuals, the Audit Committee concluded: Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadcoms former President and Chief Executive Officer, bears significant responsibility for the lack of adequate controls in the option granting process due to the tone and style of doing business he set. There is substantial evidence that Dr. Nicholas was at times involved with the selection of grant dates after the fact and with subsequent allocations of grants. There is evidence that, on at least a couple of occasions, Dr. Nicholas sought the advice of the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice 60 Table of Contents President of Human Resources regarding the process for certain option grants. He did not personally benefit from any of the restated grants. For reasons unrelated to stock options, Dr. Nicholas left Broadcom as an officer in January 2003 and did not stand for re election as a director at the May 2003 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. William J. Ruehle, Broadcoms Chief Financial Officer from March 1998 until September 19, 2006, was at the center of the flawed option granting process. Mr. Ruehle retired from Broadcom two days before he was to be interviewed as part of the conduct review. Mr. Ruehle bears a substantial measure of responsibility for the lack of adequate controls and appropriate documentation in the option granting process. There is substantial evidence he engaged in the selection of grant dates after the fact. There is also substantial evidence that he engaged in subsequent allocations of grants. Mr. Ruehle failed to provide proper advice concerning proper accounting standards or to establish proper procedures. He was involved with grants for which the grant date was selected after the fact, and personally received options included in some of such grants. Nancy M. Tullos, Broadcoms former Vice President of Human Resources from August 1998 until June 30, 2003, also bears significant responsibility for the lack of controls and deficiencies in the option granting process. She was heavily involved in the flawed option granting process. While there is a lack of evidence that Ms. Tullos herself selected grant dates after the fact, there is substantial evidence she was heavily involved in that process, was fully aware of what was occurring, and encouraged, assisted in, and enabled it. There is also substantial evidence that Ms. Tullos was at the center of allocations of grants to individuals after the grants were made. She was involved with grants for which the grant date was selected after the fact, and personally received options included in some of such grants. None of these individuals agreed to be interviewed by the Audit Committees independent counsel during the conduct review. The Audit Committee also found that a former Treasurer initiated or implemented, together with Mr. Ruehle, the selection of a few grant dates after the fact in late 2002. This Broadcom employee retired in December 2006 from his then mid level position in the Information Technology Department as a result of the conduct review. With respect to these individuals who were, to varying degrees, actively responsible for the lack of controls and the inappropriate grant practices, the following remedial steps were recommended by the Audit Committee and taken by Broadcoms Board of Directors in mid December, 2006: Each of these individuals either left Broadcom in 2003 for reasons unrelated to stock option practices or has recently retired from Broadcom as a result of the conduct review. Broadcom has repriced and terminated all of Mr. Ruehles outstanding exercisable options granted after the Companys initial public offering. The net value prior to repricing of Mr. Ruehles terminated options on December 15, 2006 exceeded $32 million. Broadcom also purchased from Mr. Ruehle at fair market value his outstanding vested options granted prior to Broadcoms initial public offering. A description of Broadcoms agreement with Mr. Ruehle pertaining to his options is included in Part III, Item 11 of this Report. Broadcom has terminated all of Ms. Tullos outstanding exercisable options. The net value of Ms. Tullos terminated options on December 15, 2006 exceeded $4 million. Broadcom has repriced and terminated all of the outstanding exercisable options granted after 2002 to the former Treasurer who left Broadcom because of the conduct review, and has repriced his earlier granted options. The net value prior to repricing of his terminated options on December 15, 2006 exceeded $450,000. None of these former employees will receive any financial assistance that Broadcom may decide to make available to other employees to offset any tax consequences of the restatement. Dr. Nicholas has no outstanding options. 61 Table of Contents The Audit Committee also found that two other employees who were not responsible for the selection of grant dates or initiating subsequent allocations, and who gave appropriate advice concerning option grants could nonetheless have been more alert that option granting practices were, or may have been, questionable or lacking in adequate controls. The Audit Committee concluded that these employees did not follow up as fully as they could have to address inadequacies in the option granting process. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors confirmed their confidence in the ability of these individuals to fully perform their responsibilities in the future. These two individuals have voluntarily agreed to the repricing of their outstanding options to the fair market value of Broadcoms stock on the correct measurement dates and not to be included in any financial assistance Broadcom may make available to its other employees to offset any tax consequences of the restatement. Compensation Committee members executed as of unanimous written consents effecting the grants. The Audit Committee found that these Compensation Committee members reasonably relied on the advice of the responsible officers and employees and that management would present them with appropriate documents for execution. The Audit Committee also concluded that Dr. Henry Samueli, a member of the Equity Award Committee and currently Broadcoms Chairman and Chief Technical Officer, while involved with the flawed option granting process, reasonably relied on management and other professionals regarding the correct option accounting treatment and grant approval process. The Audit Committee also found that all outside directors reasonably relied on management and other professionals regarding the correct option accounting treatment and grant approval process. Finally, the Audit Committee concluded that both Scott A. McGregor, Broadcoms current President and Chief Executive Officer (who joined Broadcom in 2005), and Bruce E. Kiddoo, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer (who assumed his position as Acting Chief Financial Officer when Mr. Ruehle retired on September 19, 2006), are appropriate individuals to certify Broadcoms financial statements. On December 15 and 18, 2006, Broadcoms Board of Directors considered and approved each of the Audit Committees findings and conclusions with respect to the conduct review. Restatement of Our Consolidated Financial Statements As a result of the findings of our equity award review, our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2005 have been restated. The restated consolidated financial statements include unaudited financial information for interim periods of 2005 and 2004 consistent with Article 10 01 of Regulation S X. We also recorded additional stock based compensation expense and associated tax adjustments affecting our previously reported financial statements for 1998 through 2002, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to our additional paid in capital, deferred compensation and accumulated deficit accounts as of December 31, 2002, in the amounts of $2.282 billion, $486.0 million and $1.796 billion, respectively. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 62 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the additional deferred compensation recorded on an annual basis as a result of the equity award review, categorized by each of the three reasons that led to the determination that particular option grants failed to meet the measurement date criteria of APB 25, together with the other adjustments made that were not related to changes in measurement dates: Cumulative Cumulative Amount Amount Years Ended December 31, December 31, Years Ended December 31, December 31, 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2002 2003 2004 2005 2005 (In thousands) Additional Deferred Compensation Recorded No contemporaneous documentation $ 19,984 $ 119,342 $ 572,114 $ 234,552 $ 77,057 $ 1,023,049 $ 14,015 $ $ $ 1,037,064 Date selection 226,198 442,993 45,013 178,341 892,545 11,936 904,481 Subsequent allocation 619,356 58,421 677,777 677,777 Other adjustments(a) 18,916 11,182 13,513 6,944 4,770 55,325 (3,150 ) 79 16 52,270 $ 38,900 $ 356,722 $ 1,647,976 $ 286,509 $ 318,589 $ 2,648,696 $ 22,801 $ 79 $ 16 $ 2,671,592 (a) Represents the following adjustments to deferred compensation that were not directly related to changes in measurement dates: 1) grants to consultants; 2) grants related to incorrect commencement dates of employment; 3) modifications to the stock options of terminated employees reflecting either acceleration of the vesting period of such options or the extension of the post service exercise period of vested stock options; and 4) additional adjustments for modifications that were previously accounted for correctly but that required additional adjustment due to revised measurement dates. The following table summarizes the activity in additional deferred compensation as well as additional stock based compensation expense and related tax adjustments on an annual basis. This table does not include previously recorded activity in deferred compensation or stock based compensation expense.

decrease in total shareholders equity for related tax adjustments of $0.4 million in 2003. At December 31, 2000 we had an additional net deferred tax asset of $174.1 million for additional stock based compensation expense, which was subsequently offset with a valuation allowance in 2002. There were no changes in wages and related benefits and total shareholders equity prior to 2003. 66 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of the additional stock based compensation expense and related income tax adjustments (but not other tax adjustments) resulting from the review of our equity award practices on our previously reported stock based compensation expense on an annual basis: Stock Based Compensation Expense As Reported Adjustments As Restated (In thousands) Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 60,004 $ 42,011 $ 102,015 Year ended December 31, 2004 74,687 43,714 118,401 Year ended December 31, 2003 577,487 333,609 911,096 Year ended December 31, 2002 419,663 548,450 968,113 Year ended December 31, 2001 511,010 916,879 1,427,889 Year ended December 31, 2000 120,209 274,555 394,764 Year ended December 31, 1999 4,713 48,241 52,954 Year ended December 31, 1998 1,900 8,106 10,006 $ 1,769,673 $ 2,215,565 $ 3,985,238 Overview Broadcom Corporation is a global leader in semiconductors for wired and wireless communications. Our products enable the delivery of voice, video, data and multimedia to and throughout the home, the office and the mobile environment. Broadcom provides the industrys broadest portfolio of state of the art system on a chip and software solutions to manufacturers of computing and networking equipment, digital entertainment and broadband access products, and mobile devices. Our diverse product portfolio includes solutions for digital cable, satellite and Internet Protocol (IP) set top boxes and media servers; high definition television (HDTV); high definition DVD players and personal video recording (PVR) devices; cable and DSL modems and residential gateways; high speed transmission and switching for local, metropolitan, wide area and storage networking; SystemI/O server solutions; broadband network and security processors; wireless and personal area networking; cellular communications; mobile multimedia and applications processors; mobile power management; and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gateway and telephony systems. Net Revenue. We sell our products to leading manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment in each of our target markets. Because we leverage our technologies across different markets, certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in multiple markets. We utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products. Our net revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products. Such sales represented 99.1%, 99.0% and 98.5% of our total net revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We derive the remainder of our net revenue predominantly from software licenses, development agreements, support and maintenance agreements and cancellation fees. The majority of our sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force. Sales made through distributors represented approximately 15.6%, 9.6% and 7.1% of our total net revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 was the result of more of our solutions being sold through distributors in Asia. The demand for our products has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets; our ability to specify, develop or acquire, complete, introduce, market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner; the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory; 67 Table of Contents seasonality in the demand for consumer products into which our solutions are incorporated; the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets; and the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products. For these and other reasons, our net revenue and results of operations in 2005 and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations. From time to time, our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. We expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the increasing volume of Broadcom solutions that are incorporated into consumer products, sales of which are typically subject to greater seasonality and greater volume fluctuations than non consumer OEM products. Sales to our five largest customers, including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors, as a percentage of net revenue were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Motorola 15.5 % 12.4 % * Hewlett Packard * 12.9 15.5 % Dell * * 11.9 Five largest customers as a group 45.3 51.1 51.6 * Less than 10% of net revenue. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2006 and for the foreseeable future. The identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period. Net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the United States, excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the United States, as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Asia (primarily in Taiwan, Korea and China) 17.8 % 15.0 % 19.6 % Europe (primarily in France and the United Kingdom) 7.6 6.4 5.9 Other 0.4 0.2 0.3 25.8 % 21.6 % 25.8 % Net revenue derived from shipments to international destinations, primarily to Asia (including foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the United States), represented 84.5%, 79.0% and 77.7% of our net revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. All of our revenue to date has been denominated in U.S. dollars. Gross Margin. Our gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our product mix and volume of product sales; stock based compensation expense; the position of our products in their respective life cycles; 68 Table of Contents the effects of competition; the effects of competitive pricing programs; manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies; fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly, packaging and testing costs, and overhead costs such as mask and prototyping costs; product warranty costs; provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; amortization of purchased intangible assets; and licensing and royalty arrangements. Net Income (Loss). Our net income (loss) has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: stock based compensation expense; amortization of purchased intangible assets; in process research and development, or IPR&D; litigation costs; settlement costs; impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; income tax benefits from adjustments to tax reserves of foreign subsidiaries; gain (loss) on strategic investments; stock option exchange expense; and restructuring costs or reversals thereof. In 2005 our net income was $367.1 million as compared to $173.2 million in 2004, a difference of $193.9 million. This improvement in profitability in 2005 was the direct result of an 11.3% improvement in net revenue and a 2.4 percentage point improvement in gross margin. This resulted in an increase of $199.1 million in gross profit. In addition, we had reductions in 2005 in stock based compensation expense, IPR&D, impairment of intangible assets and provision for income taxes, totaling $150.0 million, offset by an increase in settlement costs of $41.3 million. Product Cycles. The cycle for test, evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months, with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development, selling, general and administrative efforts, and investments in inventory, to the time we generate corresponding revenue, if any. The rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter. If anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our results of operations for that quarter, and potentially for future quarters, would be materially and adversely affected. Acquisition Strategy. An element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and or enhance our technological capabilities. We plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise, including acquisitions and other business combination transactions, strategic relationships, capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets. 69 Table of Contents In 2005, 2004 and 2003 we completed eleven acquisitions for original aggregate equity consideration of $292.2 million and cash consideration of $209.3 million. In 2005 we acquired Alliant Networks, Inc., a developer of WLAN embedded software; Zeevo, Inc., a developer of Bluetooth headset chipsets; Siliquent Technologies Inc., a developer of 10 Gigabit Ethernet server controllers; and Athena Semiconductors, Inc., a developer of mobile digital television tuner and low power Wi Fi technology. In 2004 we acquired RAIDCore, Inc., a developer of redundant array of inexpensive disks, or RAID, and virtualization software; Sand Video, Inc., a developer of advanced video compression semiconductor technology; M Stream, Inc., a developer of technology for signal to noise ratio performance improvements in cellular handsets; WIDCOMM, Inc., a provider of software solutions for Bluetooth wireless products; Zyray Wireless Inc., a developer of baseband co processors addressing UMTS mobile devices; and Alphamosaic Limited, a developer of advanced mobile imaging, multimedia and 3D graphics technology optimized for use in cellular phones and other mobile devices. In 2003 we acquired certain assets of Gadzoox Networks, Inc., a provider of storage networking technology. Because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Enterprise Segments. We operate in one reportable operating segment, wired and wireless broadband communications. SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, or SFAS 131, establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports. SFAS 131 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. Although we had four operating segments at December 31, 2005, under the aggregation criteria set forth in SFAS 131 we operate in only one reportable operating segment, wired and wireless broadband communications. Under SFAS 131, two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of SFAS 131, if the segments have similar economic characteristics, and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas: the nature of products and services; the nature of the production processes; the type or class of customer for their products and services; and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services. We meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons: the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments; the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard CMOS manufacturing processes; the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer: manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment, which incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products; and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors. All of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model, operate at similar gross margins, and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling, general and administrative expenses. The causes for variation among each of our operating segments are the same and include factors such as (i) life cycle and price and cost fluctuations, (ii) number of competitors, (iii) product differentiation and (iv) size of market opportunity. Additionally, each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required are similar for each operating segment. Finally, even though we periodically reorganize our operating segments based upon changes in customers, end markets or products, acquisitions, long 70 Table of Contents term growth strategies, and the experience and bandwidth of the senior executives in charge, the common financial goals for each operating segment remain constant. Because we meet each of the criteria set forth in SFAS 131 and our four operating segments as of December 31, 2005 share similar economic characteristics, we aggregate our results of operations into one reportable operating segment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, stock based compensation expense, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, restructuring costs, litigation and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Net Revenue We recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. These criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment. However, we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met, when applicable. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. Product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers. Customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements, when applicable, are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered. We assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Sales Returns and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as competitive pricing programs and rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. Inventory and Warranty Reserves. We establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves could be required. Our products typically carry a one to three year warranty. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive 71 Table of Contents product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates, product recalls, repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure, as well as possible claims for consequential costs. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required. In that event, our gross profit and gross margins would be reduced. Stock Based Compensation Expense for 2006 and Thereafter. Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS 123R, which requires all share based payments, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights, to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values. Under this standard, the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments. The Black Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS 123R but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards, such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability. The determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the Black Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk free interest rate and expected dividends. We use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black Scholes model. Our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative than historical volatility. The expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future. The risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. Stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in 2006 and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The amount of stock based compensation expense in 2006 and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience. Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions. Had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 assuming the application of the Black Scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Applied to the Restatement of Broadcoms Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for stock option grants awarded between June 1998 and May 2003. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired, other than goodwill, impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or (iv) any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets, 72 Table of Contents including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. As a result of our cumulative losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities, we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions. In certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses, we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In the future, if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance, we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization. We record estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal proceedings. We prosecute and defend these matters aggressively. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or one time license fees or running royalties, which could adversely impact gross profit and gross margins in future periods, or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for Broadcom. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Applied to the Restatement of Broadcoms Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our restated consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates 73 Table of Contents and assumptions that affected the amount of the recorded additional deferred compensation and stock based compensation expense. We used three methodologies to calculate the adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for stock option grants awarded between June 1998 and May 2003. Equity Edge Entry Date In many instances, the new measurement date applied to an affected option grant was the date the grant was entered into our Equity Edge software system, which we used to monitor and administer our equity award programs from 1998 through 2006. This methodology was used for: (1) option grants to employees other than Section 16 Officers for which we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation confirming that an Equity Award Committee meeting occurred on the indicated grant date; (2) those broad based option grants for which we had not completed allocations of options to individual employees by the time the grant date was selected by the Equity Award or Compensation Committee; and (3) those option grants for which the grant date was selected after the date indicated on the unanimous written consent documenting the approval of those options. When an option grant was entered into Equity Edge, the entry date was recorded by the system. Also, once option grants were entered into Equity Edge, individual grant information was generally transmitted to an online brokerage website on which employees were able to view their specific option grants. We believe in most cases, the Equity Edge entry date represents the best approximation of the date on which the measurement date criteria of APB 25 were met. Therefore, in each of the three circumstances described above, we usually determined that the date on which an option grant was entered into the Equity Edge system represented the best approximation of the appropriate measurement date under APB 25. We considered three alternate revised measurement dates or values for these option grants: First, we considered alternate measurement dates based on the date seven days prior to the date of each grants entry into Equity Edge. This alternative was based on evidence obtained during our equity award review that indicated that most grants were entered into Equity Edge a number of days after the date on which the measurement date criteria of APB 25 had been met. Had we used the dates seven days prior to the dates of entry into Equity Edge, rather than the later Equity Edge entry dates, our total gross additional deferred compensation adjustment of $2.672 billion would have been reduced by $24.2 million. Second, we considered measurement dates based on the date fourteen days prior to the date of each grants entry into Equity Edge. Again, this alternative was based on evidence obtained during our equity award review which indicated that most grants were entered into Equity Edge a number of days after the date on which the measurement date criteria of APB 25 had been met. Had we used the dates fourteen days prior to the dates of entry into Equity Edge rather than the later Equity Edge entry dates, our total gross additional deferred compensation adjustment of $2.672 billion would have been reduced by $116.7 million. Third, we considered an alternate measurement approach based on the average closing stock price during the period between the date indicated on the unanimous written consent documenting each option grant approval and the date of each grants entry into Equity Edge. Had we used the average closing stock prices as the basis for measurement rather than measurement on the dates of entry into Equity Edge, our total gross additional deferred compensation adjustment of $2.672 billion would have been reduced by $409.5 million. With respect to option grants for which we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation confirming that an Equity Award Committee meeting had occurred on the indicated grant date, we also considered using the indicated grant date as the measurement date under APB 25. Although this approach would have resulted in a substantially lower deferred compensation adjustment as compared to the methodology we used, we were not able to conclude that the indicated grant date represented the best approximation of the date the terms of the option were determined with finality. We also considered whether variable accounting should apply to such option grants. Generally, variable accounting applies when a particular grants exercise price, the number of shares, or both, are unknown until after the date of 74 Table of Contents grant. Variable accounting could also be applicable if the option grant were subject to some modification of terms. In our particular circumstances, the exercise prices and number of shares underlying the affected option grants were known and not subject to any change, and therefore we determined that variable accounting is not appropriate for these awards. Date of Execution of Unanimous Written Consent For option grants to Section 16 Officers for which we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation confirming that a Compensation Committee meeting occurred on the indicated grant date, the new measurement date applied to the affected option grant was the date that the unanimous written consent ratifying the option grant was likely signed, rather than the as of date specified on the consent. The date that each unanimous written consent ratifying the option grant was likely signed was determined based either on interview evidence indicating that a unanimous written consent was signed on a particular Board of Directors meeting date, or a facsimile header indicating the date on which a unanimous written consent was signed and returned to Broadcom. With respect to these option grants we also considered using the indicated grant date or the date of entry into the Equity Edge system as the measurement date under APB 25. Had we used the indicated grant date, our total gross additional deferred compensation adjustment of $2.672 billion would have been reduced by $73.7 million. Had we used the dates of entry into the Equity Edge system in these instances rather than the dates that the unanimous written consents ratifying these Section 16 Officer option grants were likely signed, our additional deferred compensation adjustment would have been reduced by $5.6 million. Date of Notification to Employee Recipients In those instances in which option grants were awarded but we did not notify the employees of such option grants for an extended period, the additional deferred compensation was calculated based on our best approximation of the date on which notification of the option grant to the affected employee occurred and the fair market value of the shares at the time of notification. For 78% of these option grants, we located copies of written grant notifications, which were signed and dated by the employee recipient, or signed by the employee recipient and dated by the Shareholder Services or Human Resources Department when received. While we believe that notification is not an explicit criterion required by APB 25 to establish a measurement date, in these instances we determined that the date of notification to those employees represented the best approximation of the date on which the measurement date criteria could have been met with finality, and that the date recorded on the written notification represented the best approximation of the appropriate measurement date under APB 25. For each of the remaining 22% of the affected option grants for which we were unable to locate documentation of written option grant notification (representing fewer than 0.6% of the total number of grants made from June 1998 through May 2003), we identified an approximate range of dates during which employee notification likely occurred. The ranges were determined based on periodic option grant reports that were prepared using the Equity Edge system. We concluded that the average closing stock price during each date range represented the best approximation of the intrinsic value of each option grant for which we were unable to locate documentation of written option grant notification. The above conclusion is based on a test in which we measured three alternate values for the 78% of grants for which we were able to ascertain actual notification dates: (1) the average closing stock price during the notification date range; (2) the highest closing stock price during the notification date range; and (3) the lowest closing stock price during the notification date range for each grant. The average price produced the 75 Table of Contents result that most closely approximated the amount of additional stock based compensation expense resulting from the actual notice dates: Gross Additional Stock Based Compensation Difference from Method Expense Actual Notice % Difference Actual Notice $ 403.7 million Average Price $ 386.4 million $ (17.3) million (4.3 )% Highest Price $ 597.6 million 193.9 million 48.0 Lowest Price $ 179.6 million (224.1) million (55.5 ) Had we used the dates of entry into the Equity Edge system in these instances, rather than the later notification dates, our total gross additional deferred compensation adjustment would have been reduced by $251.1 million.

See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. 76 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Net Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit The following table presents net revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit for 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Net revenue $ 2,670,788 100.0 % $ 2,400,610 100.0 % $ 270,178 11.3 % Cost of revenue(1) 1,267,799 47.5 1,196,767 49.9 71,032 5.9 Gross profit $ 1,402,989 52.5 % $ 1,203,843 50.1 % $ 199,146 16.5 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense resulting from stock options and restricted stock units we issued or assumed in acquisitions. For a further discussion of stock based compensation expense, see the section entitled Stock Based Compensation Expense below. Net Revenue. Our revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products. Net revenue is revenue less reductions for rebates and provisions for returns and allowances. The following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their respective contributions to the increase in net revenue in 2005 as compared to 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Enterprise networking $ 1,063,142 39.8 % $ 1,121,090 46.7 % $ (57,948 ) (5.2 )% Broadband communications 919,798 34.4 780,383 32.5 139,415 17.9 Mobile and wireless 687,848 25.8 499,137 20.8 188,711 37.8 Net revenue $ 2,670,788 100.0 % $ 2,400,610 100.0 % $ 270,178 11.3 The 2005 decrease in net revenue from our enterprise networking target market resulted primarily from the previously anticipated decline in shipments of our Intel processor based server chipsets, which resulted in a $206.8 million decrease in net revenue for those products, offset by an increase in net revenue for our enterprise Ethernet and controller products. The 2005 increase in net revenue from our broadband communications target market resulted primarily from an increase in net revenue from solutions for broadband modems. The 2005 increase in net revenue from our mobile and wireless target market resulted primarily from strength in our Bluetooth and mobile multimedia product offerings, partially offset by weakness in our cellular handset and wireless LAN businesses in the first half of 2005. Our enterprise networking products include Ethernet transceivers, controllers, switches, broadband network and security processors, server chipsets and storage products. Our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modems, DSL applications, digital cable, direct broadcast satellite and IP set top boxes, digital TVs and HD DVD and personal video recording devices. Our mobile and wireless products include wireless LAN, cellular, Bluetooth, mobile multimedia and VoIP solutions. We recorded rebates to certain customers of $220.8 million and $263.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. We account for rebates in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products), and, accordingly, record reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in our various rebate agreements. Historically, reversals of rebate accruals have not been material. We anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based on the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs and as specific rebate programs contractually end and unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment. However, we do not expect 77 Table of Contents rebates to impact our gross margin as our prices to these customers and corresponding revenue and margins are already net of such rebates. Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit. Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries, costs associated with our purchase of assembly, test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products, mask and prototyping costs, amortization of purchased technology, and manufacturing overhead, including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, product warranty costs, provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and stock based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support. The 2005 increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the 11.3% increase in net revenue. Gross margin increased from 50.1% in 2004 to 52.5% in 2005. The primary factors that contributed to this 2.4 percentage point improvement were improvements in product margin due to (i) changes in product mix, (ii) benefits from the favorable foundry pricing we were able to negotiate at the beginning of 2005 and (iii) other product cost savings, particularly in the area of yield improvements. In addition, gross margin increased due to a decrease in provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty costs as compared to 2004. Gross margin has been and will likely continue to be impacted by competitive pricing programs, fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly, packaging and testing costs, product warranty costs, provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, possible future changes in product mix, and the introduction of products with lower margins, among other factors. Our gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense and changes therein, as discussed below, and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions. Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table presents research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses for 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development(1) $ 681,047 25.5 % $ 598,697 24.9 % $ 82,350 13.8 % Selling, general and administrative(1) 274,260 10.3 244,037 10.2 30,223 12.4 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense resulting from stock options and restricted stock units we issued or assumed in acquisitions. For a further discussion of stock based compensation expense, see the section entitled Stock Based Compensation Expense below. Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research, design and development activities, including stock based compensation expense, costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware, mask and prototyping costs, subcontracting costs and facilities expenses. The 2005 increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase of $81.2 million in personnel related expenses. The increase in personnel related expenses is attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in 2005, resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions, as well as increased cash compensation levels. Based upon past experience, we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve, new product opportunities, changes in our compensation policies and any expansion into new markets and technologies. For a further discussion of the decrease in stock based compensation, see Stock Based Compensation Expense, below. We remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate. We currently hold more than 1,900 78 Table of Contents U.S. patents, and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional U.S. and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses, including stock based compensation, legal and other professional fees, facilities expenses, communications expenses and advertising expenses. The 2005 increase in selling, general and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increase of $28.1 million in personnel related expenses. This increase in personnel related expenses is attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in selling, general and administrative activities in 2005, resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions, as well as increased cash compensation levels. Based upon past experience, we anticipate that selling, general and administrative expense will continue to increase over the long term to support any expansion of our operations through periodic changes in our infrastructure, changes in our compensation policies, acquisition and integration activities, international operations, and current and future litigation. For a further discussion of stock based compensation, see Stock Based Compensation Expense, below. Stock Based Compensation Expense. Stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from stock options and restricted stock units issued to employees and unvested equity compensation instruments assumed in acquisitions. Deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective service periods of the applicable unvested securities, generally four years. During 2005 we recorded $204.9 million of deferred compensation primarily related to the issuance of 8.4 million restricted stock units in connection with our regular annual equity compensation review for employees as well as for new hire and other grants. This deferred compensation is being amortized ratably over the service periods of the underlying restricted stock units, generally 16 quarters. The following table presents details of the total stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 4,177 $ 4,776 Research and development 68,606 102,253 Selling, general and administrative 29,232 30,897 $ 102,015 $ 137,926 The decrease in research and development stock based compensation expense in 2005 related primarily to a reduction in the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from stock options we issued or assumed in acquisitions becoming fully vested, partially offset by the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the issuance of restricted stock units in 2005. The following table presents details of the additional stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item above as a result of our restatement (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 2,431 $ 3,409 Research and development 28,037 43,642 Selling, general and administrative 11,543 16,188 $ 42,011 $ 63,239 79 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2006 we adopted SFAS 123R, which is a revision of SFAS 123 and requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The amount of unearned stock based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2011 related to unvested share based payment awards at December 31, 2005, as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123, is $770.0 million. Of this amount, $354.8 million, $261.4 million, $127.0 million and $26.8 million are currently estimated to be recorded in 2006, 2007, 2008 and thereafter, respectively. The weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.4 years. Approximately 97% of the total unearned stock based compensation at December 31, 2005 will be expensed by the end of 2008. As a result of our restatement, we increased the amount of our unearned stock based compensation at December 31, 2005 by $60.0 million, which is included in the $770.0 million amount above. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our operating expenses will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions. We granted employee stock options to purchase 12.4 million shares of our common stock and 6.2 million restricted stock units in the second quarter of 2006 as part of our regular annual equity compensation review program. We will recognize up to $415.4 million of stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to those awards. This unearned stock based compensation is being amortized ratably over the service periods of the underlying stock options and restricted stock units, generally 48 months and 16 quarters, respectively. For an additional discussion of the effects of expensing of stock options, see Recent Accounting Pronouncements, below. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents details of the amortization of purchased intangible assets by expense category: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 11,081 $ 12,821 Operating expense 4,033 3,703 $ 15,114 $ 16,524 The following table presents details of the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets that will be amortized to future cost of revenue and operating expense: Net Purchased Intangibles Assets at December 31, Amortizable in 2005 2006 2007 (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 5,423 $ 4,940 $ 483 Operating expense 1,909 1,735 174 $ 7,332 $ 6,675 $ 657 Settlement Costs We recorded $110.0 million in settlement costs in 2005 primarily related to the settlement of securities class action litigation against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. We recorded $68.7 million in settlement costs in 2004. Of that amount $60.0 million was related to the settlement of various litigation matters, and the remaining $8.7 million reflected settlement costs related to a claim arising from an acquisition and certain indemnification costs. For a more detailed discussion of our settled and outstanding litigation, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 80 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development IPR&D totaled $43.5 million and $63.8 million for acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amounts allocated to IPR&D were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of purchase price. The fair value of the IPR&D for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. Each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance on core technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development. Future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account product life cycles and market penetration and growth rates. The IPR&D charges include only the fair value of IPR&D performed as of the respective acquisition dates. The fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets. We believe the amounts recorded as IPR&D, as well as developed technology, represent the fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the dates of the respective acquisitions. The following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations of IPR&D for our acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2004: Weighted Average Average Risk Estimated Estimated Estimated Adjusted Percent Time to Cost to Discount Company Acquired Development Projects Complete Complete Complete Rate IPR&D (In years) (In millions) (In millions) 2005 Acquisitions Zeevo Bluetooth wireless audio chipset 85 % 1.0 $ 5.5 22 % $ 6.7 Siliquent 10 GbE server controller 40 1.0 17.3 27 35.0 Athena Tuners and low power Wi Fi 85 0.5 0.9 27 1.8 2004 Acquisitions RAIDCore RAID software stack 60 1.0 1.8 23 2.3 Sand Video Decoder/codec chips 45 1.5 6.4 28 20.5 M Stream Algorithm implemented in DSP chip 30 1.0 1.3 26 3.7 Zyray UMTS baseband co processor 80 1.0 5.6 24 25.9 Alphamosaic Multimedia co processor 50 1.0 11.5 21 11.3 We completed the development projects related to all of our 2004 acquisitions, except for Sand Video. In the case of Sand Video, we reallocated the resources to focus on semiconductor products that we believe are a higher priority. We also completed the development project related to the Zeevo acquisition. At December 31, 2005 all other 2005 development projects were still in process. Except for the Sand Video project, actual results to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions. The assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the IPR&D projects, estimated costs to complete the projects, and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market. 81 Table of Contents As of the respective acquisition dates of the 2005 and 2004 acquisitions, certain ongoing development projects were in process. Research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease % Change (In thousands, except percentages) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 500 0.0 % $ 18,000 0.7 % $ (17,500 ) (97.2 )% We performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with various acquisitions as required under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, in October 2005 and 2004. Upon completion of the 2005 and 2004 annual impairment assessments, we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair values of our four reporting units, determined and identified in accordance with SFAS 142, exceeded their respective carrying values. We estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method, taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our Board of Directors. Cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in FASB Concepts Statement 7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements, or Concepts Statement 7. Specifically, the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from 13% to 17%, and terminal value growth rates ranging from 0% to 10%. Publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology. In November 2005 we acquired an issued U.S. patent, with various foreign counterparts, related to integrated circuit package testing for $0.5 million. In January 2004 we acquired approximately 80 patents and patent applications related to the read channel and hard disk controller market for $18.0 million. The immediate purpose for acquiring these patent portfolios was to assist us in the defense and settlement of then ongoing and future intellectual property litigation. As a result, we were unable to estimate any future cash flows from the patents. We also did not have any plans to resell the patents to a third party. Due to our intended use for these assets, we concluded that indicators of impairment existed upon acquisition of the patents because the carrying value of the patents might not be recoverable. Upon determining that indicators of impairment existed, we performed recoverability tests in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or SFAS 144. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of long lived assets should include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The only cash flows expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the patents are the cash savings expected to result from reduced but undeterminable litigation expenses over the next several years. Due to the unpredictable nature of legal disputes, it is not possible to reasonably: (i) determine if our strategy with respect to the patents will be successful, (ii) forecast litigation expenses that would have been incurred if the patent portfolio had not been acquired, or (iii) forecast cash flows generated as a result of acquiring the patents. As a result, no reasonable analysis could be prepared to support future cash flows associated with the patents. Accordingly, pursuant to SFAS 144 the patents were determined to be fully impaired at their respective 82 Table of Contents dates of acquisition. The impairment charge for the patent portfolio was classified as an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the consolidated statements of operations in 2004. See Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Restructuring Costs For a discussion of activity and liability balances related to our past restructuring plans, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and Other Income, Net The following table presents interest and other income, net, for 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Interest income, net $ 51,207 1.9 % $ 15,010 0.6 % $ 36,197 241.2 % Other income, net 3,465 0.1 7,317 0.3 (3,852 ) (52.6 ) Interest income, net, reflects interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The increase in interest income, net, was the result of an overall increase in our cash and marketable securities balances and an increase in market interest rates. Our cash and marketable securities balances increased from $1.276 billion at December 31, 2004 to $1.876 billion at December 31, 2005. The weighted average interest rates earned for 2005 and 2004 were 3.48% and 1.73%, respectively. Other income, net, primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment. We recognized gains from sales of strategic investments in the amounts of $1.2 million and $5.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents the provision for income taxes for 2005 and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (20,220 ) (0.8 )% $ 56,082 2.3 % $ (76,302 ) (136.1 )% The federal statutory rate was 35% for 2005 and 2004. For 2005 we recorded no tax benefits for our domestic tax losses. Other differences between our effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 resulted primarily from a favorable geographic mix of income and reduced foreign tax rates in 2005. In addition, we realized tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period tax accruals of $28.3 million and $21.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes related to the prior periods. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. SFAS 109 states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. As a result our recent cumulative losses in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, and the full utilization of our loss carryback 83 Table of Contents opportunities, we have concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded in such jurisdictions. In certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $1.4 million in 2005 in accordance with SFAS 109. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of our restatement, we recorded an income tax benefit of $19.5 million in 2004 related to income tax benefits realized from employee stock option exercises in 2004 that reduced our tax liabilities. Prior to the restatement, such income tax benefits were credited to additional paid in capital because there was no associated stock based compensation expense on such employee stock options. No income tax benefits were recorded for additional stock based compensation in 2005 because of our domestic tax losses prior to deductions for employee stock options. Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Net Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit The following table presents net revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit for 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Net revenue $ 2,400,610 100.0 % $ 1,610,095 100.0 % $ 790,515 49.1 % Cost of revenue(1) 1,196,767 49.9 866,359 53.8 330,408 38.1 Gross profit $ 1,203,843 50.1 % $ 743,736 46.2 % $ 460,107 61.9 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense resulting from stock options and restricted stock units we issued or assumed in acquisitions, as well as the effects of our stock option exchange program in 2003. For a further discussion of stock based compensation expense, see the section entitled Stock Based Compensation Expense below. Net Revenue. The following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their respective contributions to the increase in net revenue in 2004 as compared to 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (In thousands, except percentages) Enterprise networking $ 1,121,090 46.7 % $ 917,876 57.0 % $ 203,214 22.1 % Broadband communications 780,383 32.5 373,562 23.2 406,821 108.9 Mobile and wireless 499,137 20.8 318,657 19.8 180,480 56.6 Net revenue $ 2,400,610 100.0 % $ 1,610,095 100.0 % $ 790,515 49.1 The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets in 2004, except for Intel processor based server chipsets, included in enterprise networking, which declined. The previously anticipated decline in shipments of our Intel processor based server chipsets resulted in a $46.9 million decrease in net revenue for those products in 2004 as compared with 2003. We recorded rebates to certain customers in the amounts of $263.6 million and $165.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit The 2004 increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the 49.1% increase in net revenue. Gross margin increased from 46.2% in 2003 to 50.1% in 2004. The primary factors that contributed to this 3.9 percentage 84 Table of Contents point improvement in gross margin were (i) a 1.5 percentage point improvement in product margin primarily due to changes in product mix, and (ii) decreases in stock option exchange expense, stock based compensation expense and the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which improved gross margin by 1.7, 0.8 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively, offset in part by an increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of 0.4 percentage points. For a further discussion of stock based compensation, see Stock Based Compensation Expense, below. In 2004 we increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to 2003 as a result of an increase in gross inventory. The primary factors that resulted in increased inventory were the expansion of inventory in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers, shorter lead times for certain of our customers, and the buildup of buffer inventory based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products. Stock based compensation expense included in cost of revenue decreased by $39.7 million in 2004 related primarily to stock option exchange expense of $28.2 million recorded in 2003 with no comparable charge in 2004, as well as the vesting in full of certain stock options that we issued or assumed in acquisitions. For a further discussion, see Stock Option Exchange Expense below. Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table presents research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses for 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Decrease Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development(1) $ 598,697 24.9 % $ 732,386 45.5 % $ (133,689 ) (18.3 )% Selling, general and administrative(1) 244,037 10.2 259,258 16.1 (15,221 ) (5.9 ) (1) Includes stock based compensation expense resulting from stock options and restricted stock units we issued or assumed in acquisitions, as well as the effects of our stock option exchange program in 2003. For a further discussion of stock based compensation expense, see the section entitled Stock Based Compensation Expense below. Research and Development Expense The 2004 decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a $195.8 million decrease in stock based compensation expense offset in part by a $41.2 million increase in personnel related expenses. The increase in personnel related expenses was primarily due to a 22.3% increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in 2004, through acquisitions and hiring. In addition, there were increases in outsourced engineering, facilities and engineering design tool expenses in 2004, offset in part by lower depreciation expense on computer software and equipment. For a further discussion of stock based compensation decrease, see Stock Based Compensation Expense, below. Selling, General and Administrative Expense The 2004 decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a $38.2 million decrease in stock based compensation expense offset in part by a $22.5 million increase in personnel related expenses. The increase in personnel related expenses was primarily due to a 22.1% increase in the number of employees engaged in selling, general and administrative activities in 2004, through acquisitions and hiring. In addition, there were increases in expenses for travel and entertainment, marketing and accounting, which were offset by decreases in legal expense. For a further discussion of stock based compensation decrease, see Stock Based Compensation Expense, below. 85 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Expense The following table presents details of the total stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of operations: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 4,776 $ 44,522 Research and development 102,253 298,081 Selling, general and administrative 30,897 69,053 $ 137,926 $ 411,656 The 2004 decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to a reduction in the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from certain stock options that we issued or assumed in acquisitions becoming fully vested. In addition, included in cost of revenue in 2003 was $28.2 million in stock option exchange expense. There was no comparable expense in 2004. For a further discussion, see Stock Option Exchange Expense below. The following table presents details of the additional stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of operations as a result of the restatement (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (In thousands) Cost of revenue $ 3,409 $ 26,540 Research and development 43,642 78,744 Selling, general and administrative 16,188 24,430 $ 63,239 $ 129,714 Settlement Costs We recorded $68.7 million in settlement costs in 2004. Of this amount, $60.0 million was related to the settlement of various litigation matters, and the remaining $8.7 million reflected settlement costs related to a claim arising from an acquisition and certain indemnification costs. In May 2003 we completed a management transition at our ServerWorks Corporation subsidiary and entered into a settlement agreement resolving various issues and disputes raised by certain employees and former securities holders of ServerWorks, including issues and disputes with three departing employees, relating to agreements entered into when we acquired ServerWorks in January 2001. In connection with the settlement, we incurred $25.2 million in cash payments and expenses and recorded a one time non cash charge of $88.1 million in May 2003. This non cash charge reflected the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense, most of which was previously recorded as deferred compensation upon the acquisition of ServerWorks (and based upon stock market valuations at the time of the acquisition). In August 2003 we agreed with Intel Corporation to settle all litigation between the companies as well as litigation involving our respective affiliates. In connection with the settlement agreement, we paid Intel $60.0 million in 2003. We recorded an additional $21.2 million in settlement costs in 2003 in connection with the settlement of other litigation and third party claims. 86 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development IPR&D totaled $63.8 million for acquisitions completed in 2004. No comparable amount of IPR&D was recorded in 2003. For a description of the 2004 IPR&D projects, including the valuation techniques used and significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations, as well as an update on the status of such projects as of December 31, 2005, see the discussion included under Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, above. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with various acquisitions as required under SFAS 142, in October 2004 and 2003. There was no impairment recorded for goodwill in 2004, however we did record an $18.0 million impairment of other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144. For the description of the annual impairment assessment as well as the impairment of other intangible assets in 2004, see the comparable discussion included under Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, above. In 2003 we recorded an impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets of $439.6 million. In May 2003 we determined that indicators of impairment existed for two of our reporting units, ServerWorks and mobile communications, and an additional impairment assessment was performed at that time. Based on that assessment, we recorded a charge of $438.6 million in June 2003 to write down the value of goodwill associated with the affected reporting units. Of this charge, $414.5 million represented the balance of goodwill related to the ServerWorks reporting unit and $24.1 million represented the balance of goodwill related to the mobile communications reporting unit. In addition, in 2003 we recorded a $1.0 million impairment of other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144. For a further discussion of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the primary factors that contributed to the impairment assessment, see Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Option Exchange Expense In April 2003 we commenced an offering to our employees to voluntarily exchange certain vested and unvested stock options. Under the program, employees holding options to purchase our Class A or Class B common stock were given the opportunity to exchange certain of their existing options, with exercise prices at or above $15.72 per share. In connection with the offering, we recorded stock option exchange expenses for employees engaged in cost of revenue, research and development and selling, general and administrative activities in the amounts of $28.2 million, $319.4 million and $93.8 million, respectively in 2003. Of these amounts, we recorded additional stock option exchange expense for employees engaged in cost of revenue, research and development and selling, general and administrative activities in the amounts of $16.7 million, $154.6 million and $49.3 million, respectively, as a result of our restatement. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No comparable charges were incurred in 2004. For further discussion of stock option exchange expense, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and Other Income, Net The following table presents interest and other income, net, for 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % of Net % of Net Increase % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue (Decrease) Change (In thousands, except percentages) Interest income, net $ 15,010 0.6 % $ 6,828 0.4 % $ 8,182 119.8 % Other income, net 7,317 0.3 26,053 1.6 (18,736 ) (71.9 ) 87 Table of Contents Interest Income, Net. The increase in 2004 was primarily the result of an overall increase in our cash and marketable securities balances and an increase in market interest rates. Other Income, Net. We recognized gains from strategic investments in the amounts of $5.2 million and $24.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2003 gain on investment was incurred on an investment that was previously written down by $24.1 million in September 2002, representing an other than temporary decline in the value of that investment at the time. The 2003 gain was offset in part by $2.3 million in losses, representing other than temporary declines in the value of other strategic investments. Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents the provision for income taxes for 2004 and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % of Net % of Net % Amount Revenue Amount Revenue Increase Change (Restated) (Restated) (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 56,082 2.3 % $ 25,127 1.6 % $ 30,955 123.2 % The federal statutory rate was 35% for 2004 and 2003. The difference between our effective tax rate for 2004 and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible IPR&D and foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate. In addition, we realized tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period tax accruals of $21.3 million related to foreign subsidiaries due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes related to such periods. The difference between our effective tax rate for 2003 and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of impairment of goodwill, foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate, as well as the effects of 2003 domestic losses recorded without tax benefit. As a result of our cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks, we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in 2004 and 2003. As a result of our restatement, we recorded an income tax benefit of $19.5 million in 2004 and a cumulative income tax benefit for years prior to 2003 of $24.0 million, related to income tax benefits realized from employee stock option exercises that reduced our tax liabilities. Prior to the restatement, such income tax benefits were credited to additional paid in capital because there was no associated stock based compensation expense on such employee stock options. No income tax benefits were recorded for additional stock based compensation in 2003 because of our domestic tax losses prior to deductions for employee stock options. Financial Data for Interim Periods of 2005 and 2004 The following tables present our quarterly financial data for 2005 and 2004.

The increase in net revenue in our broadband communications target market resulted primarily from our products for direct broadcast satellite applications. In our mobile and wireless target market, the decreases in our wireless LAN and cellular handset business were partially offset by strength in Bluetooth and VoIP offerings. (2) The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets. (3) The decrease in net revenue resulted primarily from overall industry weakness, specifically related to inventory corrections in the direct broadcast satellite and networking markets. In addition, as expected, we experienced a quarter to quarter decline in shipments of our Intel processor based server chipsets of approximately $35.0 million. Our enterprise networking products include Ethernet transceivers, controllers, switches, broadband network and security processors, server chipsets and storage products. Our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modems, DSL applications, digital cable, direct broadcast satellite and IP set top boxes, digital TVs and HD DVD and personal video recording devices. Our mobile and wireless products include wireless LAN, cellular, Bluetooth, mobile multimedia and VoIP solutions. 91 Table of Contents The following tables present the impact of the additional stock

The amendment extends the program through January 26, 2007 and authorizes the repurchase of additional shares of the our Class A common stock having a total market value of up to $500 million from time to time during the period beginning January 26, 2006 and ending January 26, 2007. On July 24, 2006 our Board of Directors decided to suspend purchasing shares of Class A common stock under the share repurchase program. Stock Split On January 25, 2006 our Board of Directors approved a three for two split of our common stock, which was effected in the form of a stock dividend. Holders of record of our Class A and Class B common stock as of the close of business on February 6, 2006 Record Date) received one additional share of Class A or Class B common stock, as applicable, for every two shares of such class held on the Record Date. The additional Class A and Class B shares were distributed on or about February 21, 2006. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares. Share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect this stock split. Articles of Incorporation In June 2006 we filed Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, or the Restated Articles, with the California Secretary of State. The Restated Articles (i) increased the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock that we are authorized to issue from 800,000,000 shares to 2,500,000,000 shares, (ii) clarified that we are only authorized to issue 6,432,161 shares of preferred stock and (iii) eliminated all statements referring to the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock, all outstanding shares of which automatically converted into shares of our Class B common stock upon consummation of our initial public offering. Acquisitions In March 2006 we completed the acquisition of Sandburst Corporation, a privately held fabless semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of packet switching and routing systems on a chip that are deployed in enterprise core and metropolitan Ethernet networks. In connection with the acquisition, we paid $72.0 million in cash. In addition, we exchanged unvested stock options to purchase 0.1 million shares of our Class A common stock, which had a fair value of $4.4 million in accordance with SFAS 123R. We recorded a one time charge of $5.2 million for IPR&D expense. The amount allocated to IPR&D in the three months ended March 31, 2006 was determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and was expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed. We also assumed $7.6 million in net liabilities and recorded $40.2 million in goodwill, $30.7 million of completed technology and $3.4 million in other purchased intangible assets in connection with this acquisition. In January 2007 we completed the acquisition of LVL7 Systems, Inc., a privately held provider of production ready networking software that enables networking original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers to reduce development expenses and compress development timelines. In connection with the acquisition, Broadcom paid total consideration of approximately $62 million in cash to acquire outstanding shares of capital stock and vested stock options of LVL7 and liquidate outstanding LVL7 debt. A portion of the cash consideration payable to the stockholders was placed into escrow pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement. We may record a one time charge for purchased IPR&D expenses related to this acquisition in the first quarter of 2007. The amount of that charge, if any, has not yet been determined. Subsequent Event We recorded total charges of $10.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2006 and expect to record $50.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2006 in connection with payments we have decided to make to or on behalf of certain current and former employees related to consequences of the equity award review, as well as non cash stock based compensation expense we incurred related to the extension of the post 96 Table of Contents service stock option exercise period for certain former employees. The payments are to remunerate participants in the employee stock purchase plan who were unable to purchase shares thereunder during the period in which we were not current in our SEC reporting obligations, to remediate adverse tax consequences, if any, to individuals that may result from the equity award review, and to compensate individuals for the value of stock options that expired or would have expired during the period in which we were not current in our SEC reporting obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. We are using the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments. The adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations, although it is not expected to have a material impact on our overall financial position. The amount of unearned stock based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2011 related to share based payment awards at December 31, 2005, as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123, is $770.0 million. Of this amount, $354.8 million, $261.4 million, $127.0 million and $26.8 million are currently estimated to be recorded in 2006, 2007, 2008 and thereafter, respectively. The weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.4 years. Approximately 97% of the total unearned stock based compensation at December 31, 2005 will be expensed by the end of 2008. As a result of our restatement, we increased the amount of our unearned stock based compensation at December 31, 2005 by $60.0 million, which is included in the $770.0 million amount above. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or assumptions. We granted employee stock options to purchase 12.4 millions shares of our common stock and 6.2 million restricted stock units in the second quarter of 2006 as part of our regular annual equity compensation review program. We will recognize up to $415.4 million of stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, related to those awards. This unearned stock based compensation is being amortized ratably over the service periods of the underlying stock options and restricted stock units, generally 48 months and 16 quarters. Had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 assuming the application of the Black Scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature. This requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in 2004 related to such excess tax deductions was $62.3 million. No comparable amounts were recorded in 2005 or 2003. 97 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital and Cash and Marketable Securities. The following table presents working capital and cash and marketable securities: December 31, December 31, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) (In thousands) Working capital (restated) $ 1,736,382 $ 1,085,099 $ 651,283 Cash and cash equivalents(1) $ 1,437,276 $ 858,592 $ 578,684 Short term marketable securities(1) 295,402 324,041 (28,639 ) Long term marketable securities 142,843 92,918 49,925 $ 1,875,521 $ 1,275,551 $ 599,970 (1) Included in working capital. Our working capital increased in 2005 primarily related to cash provided by operations and cash proceeds received from issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, offset in part by cash paid to settle our securities class action litigation, the purchase of long term marketable securities and property and equipment, acquisitions, and repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock. Cash Provided and Used in 2005 and 2004. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $1.437 billion at December 31, 2005 from $858.6 million at December 31, 2004 as a result of cash provided by operating and financing activities, offset in part by cash used in investing activities. In 2005 our operating activities provided $446.7 million in cash. This was primarily the result of $367.1 million in net income and $213.3 million in net non cash operating expenses, offset in part by net cash used of $133.7 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, IPR&D, impairment of intangible assets and gains on strategic investments. In 2004 our operating activities provided $501.8 million in cash. This was primarily the result of $173.2 million in net income and $368.4 million in net non cash operating expenses, offset in part by net cash used of $39.8 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, IPR&D, impairment of intangible assets, tax benefit from stock plans and gains on strategic investments. Accounts receivable increased $102.3 million from $205.1 million in 2004 to $307.4 million in 2005. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the $281.2 million increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 to $820.6 million, as compared with $539.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. We typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms. If, in the longer term, our revenue continues to increase as it has in the most recent past, it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase. Our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers. Inventories increased $66.3 million, from $128.3 million in 2004 to $194.6 million in 2005, primarily in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers and the buildup of buffer inventories based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products. In the future, our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on the level of purchase orders received as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace. Such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels. Investing activities used cash of $173.1 million in 2005, which was primarily the result of $111.5 million net cash paid in acquisitions, the purchase of $41.8 million of capital equipment to support our operations, $21.3 million used in the net purchase of marketable securities and the purchase of $0.5 million of strategic investments, offset by $1.9 million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments. Investing activities used cash of $456.0 million in 2004, which was primarily the result of $333.3 million used in the net 98 Table of Contents purchase of marketable securities, $74.8 million net cash paid in acquisitions, the purchase of $49.9 million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of $3.2 million of strategic investments, offset by $5.2 million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments. Our financing activities provided $305.1 million in cash in 2005, which was primarily the result of $458.1 million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, offset in part by $153.8 million in repurchases of our Class A common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program implemented in February 2005 and $2.5 million for the repayment of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition. Our financing activities provided $254.1 million in cash in 2004, which was primarily the result of $253.3 million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. In January 2006 we amended our share repurchase program to authorize repurchases of Class A common stock having an aggregate market value of up to $500 million from time to time during the period beginning January 26, 2006 and ending January 26, 2007, depending on market conditions and other factors. On July 24, 2006 our Board of Directors decided to suspend purchasing shares of Class A common stock under the share repurchase program. Due to the increase in the price of our Class A common stock, a greater number of stock options were exercised by employees, and we received more proceeds from the exercise of stock options, in 2005 than in 2004. The timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control, and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past. Moreover, it is now our practice to issue a combination of restricted stock units and stock options to employees, which will reduce future growth in the number of stock options available for exercise. Unlike the exercise of stock options, the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to Broadcom and requires the use of cash as we determined to allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units during 2005 and 2006 withheld to satisfy withholding taxes and to make corresponding cash payments to the appropriate tax authorities on each employees behalf. In nine months ended September 30, 2006 we received $475.8 million in net proceeds from issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. The effects of those option exercises and stock purchases are not included in our financial position as of December 31, 2005. The restatement of our consolidated financial statements, as a result of the findings of our equity award review, did not materially or adversely affect our liquidity or capital resources. Obligations and Commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005: Payment Obligations by Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 95,862 $ 88,986 $ 64,601 $ 41,445 $ 29,733 $ 132,670 $ 453,297 Inventory and related purchase obligations 297,468 612 298,080 Other purchase obligations 38,303 2,135 40,438 Restructuring liabilities 8,083 3,663 1,790 1,790 895 16,221 Accrued settlement payments 2,047 2,000 2,000 6,047 Total $ 441,763 $ 97,396 $ 68,391 $ 43,235 $ 30,628 $ 132,670 $ 814,083 We lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2017. In December 2004 we entered into a lease agreement under which our corporate headquarters will move from its present location to new facilities in Irvine, California with an aggregate of approximately 0.7 million square feet. The lease term is for a period of ten years and two months beginning after the completion of the first two buildings and related tenant improvements, which 99 Table of Contents is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2007. The aggregate rent for the term of the lease, approximately $183.0 million, is included in the table above. Inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services. We depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services. Due to lengthy subcontractor lead times, we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months. Our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders, but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation. Other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment, computer hardware, and information systems infrastructure, and other purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business. Our restructuring liabilities represent estimated future lease and operating costs from restructured facilities, less offsetting sublease income, if any. These costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through 2010. These amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with certain settlement and license agreements entered into in 2004 and 2003. These amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon. We have additional purchase orders (not included in the table above) that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. Prospective Capital Needs. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, commitments and repurchases of our Class A common stock for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. We have filed a universal shelf registration statement on SEC Form S 3 that allows us to sell in one or more public offerings, shares of our Class A common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million. We have not issued any securities under the universal shelf registration statement. Because one of the eligibility requirements for use of a Form S 3 is that an issuer must have timely filed all reports required to be filed during the preceding twelve calendar months, we will not be able to issue shares under the Form S 3 until December 1, 2007. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. We anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans, and product and technology roadmaps; 100 Table of Contents the market acceptance of our products; repurchases of our Class A common stock; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; issuance of restricted stock units and the related payments in cash for withholding taxes due from employees during 2006 and possibly during future years; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; the availability of sufficient foundry, assembly and test capacity and packaging materials; expenses related to our restructuring plans; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets, including the effects of recent international conflicts and related uncertainties. In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. We do not use derivative financial instruments. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. Our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2005 the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. Our marketable securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, time deposits, foreign notes and certificates of deposits, are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity. In addition, in the past certain of our short term marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were stated at fair value, which was equal to cost due to the short term maturity of these securities. In the event that there were to be a difference between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities, unrealized gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less, with a weighted average maturity of no longer than 18 months. As of December 31, 2005 the carrying value and fair value of these securities were $438.2 million and $435.7 million, respectively. The fair value of our marketable securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates; however, given the short term maturities, we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant market or interest rate risk. 101 Table of Contents The carrying value, maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were as follows: Carrying Fair Value Value December 31, Maturity December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2005 (In thousands, except interest rates) Investments Cash equivalents $ 835,598 $ 835,598 $ $ $ 835,202 Weighted average interest rate 4.38 % 4.38 % Marketable securities $ 438,245 $ 295,402 $ 103,985 $ 38,858 $ 435,702 Weighted average interest rate 3.77 % 3.62 % 3.94 % 4.45 % Carrying Fair Value Value December 31, Maturity December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2004 (In thousands, except interest rates) Investments Cash equivalents $ 356,845 $ 356,845 $ $ $ 356,831 Weighted average interest rate 2.33 % 2.33 % Marketable securities $ 416,959 $ 324,041 $ 69,717 $ 23,201 $ 415,757 Weighted average interest rate 2.40 % 2.30 % 2.64 % 3.12 % Our strategic equity investments are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for our publicly traded investments. We have also invested in privately held companies, the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage. We make investments in key strategic businesses and other industry participants to establish strategic relationships, expand existing relationships, and achieve a return on our investment. These investments are inherently risky, as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Likewise, the development projects of these companies may not be successful. In addition, early stage companies often fail for various other reasons. Consequently, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. As of December 31, 2005, the carrying and fair value of our strategic investments was $5.0 million.
