ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, vascular surgery, electrophysiology, neurovascular intervention, oncology, endoscopy, urology, gynecology and neuromodulation. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for 19 Table of Contents aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our managements discussion and analysis (MDA) begins with an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2004 and focuses on the impact of drug eluting stents to our operations. Following the executive summary is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2004 as compared to 2003 and our operating results for 2003 as compared to 2002. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. Finally, MDA provides information on market risk exposures and certain legal matters. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2004 increased to $5,624 million from $3,476 million in 2003, an increase of 62 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $155 million of foreign currency fluctuations, our net sales increased 57 percent. Our gross profit increased to $4,332 million, or 77.0 percent of net sales, in 2004 from $2,515 million, or 72.4 percent of net sales, in 2003. Our reported net income for 2004 was $1,062 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, as compared to $472 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in 2003. Our reported results included net after tax charges of $332 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in 2004 as compared to net after tax charges of $49 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in 2003.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $1,804 million in 2004 as compared to $787 million in 2003. This growth in 2004 resulted largely from sales of our TAXUS Express2 paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the United States (U.S.) in March 2004 and in our Europe and Inter Continental markets during the first quarter of 2003. TAXUS stent sales in 2004 were $2,143 million, or 38 percent of our net sales, as compared to $198 million, or 6 percent of our net sales, in 2003. We have achieved leading drug eluting stent market share positions within our U.S., Europe and Inter Continental markets. We have not yet launched a drug eluting stent system within our Japan market. In the U.S., physicians have rapidly adopted drug eluting stent technology. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 85 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents. In our Europe and Inter Continental markets, conversion rates have been more gradual primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter Continental markets have converted approximately 40 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents. We continue to expect year to year growth in our drug eluting stent sales in 2005 as a result of a full year of sales in the U.S. and increased adoption rates in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. Further, our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the U.S. market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market. During 2004, we partially invested our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives, particularly related to our coronary stent franchise; we funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization; and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network. In 2005, we will continue to invest aggressively to sustain our leadership in drug eluting stent technology and to expand our new product offerings through internal development, acquisitions and strategic alliances. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2004, which increased over $1 billion as compared to 2003. In addition, due to favorable market conditions, we raised $1.1 billion from the public markets through two bond offerings during 2004. We used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuances to repay short term debt obligations, to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market and to fund 2004 strategic alliances and acquisitions, including our $740 million acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation (Advanced Bionics). The acquisition of Advanced Bionics expands our technology portfolio into the implantable microelectronic device market that physicians use to treat numerous neurological disorders. 1 The 2004 net after tax charges consisted of a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures; a $71 million enhancement to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) Plan); $65 million of purchased research and development; a $61 million charge relating to taxes on the approximately $1 billion of cash that we plan to repatriate in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and a $60 million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 net after tax charges consisted of $37 million of purchased research and development and $12 million in charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales The following table provides our net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 As As Reported Constant Reported Constant Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Basis Basis Basis Basis United States $ 3,502 $ 1,924 $ 1,756 82 % 82 % 10 % 10 % Europe $ 994 $ 672 $ 456 48 % 35 % 47 % 26 % Japan 613 541 494 13 % 6 % 10 % 2 % Inter Continental 515 339 213 52 % 44 % 59 % 48 % International $ 2,122 $ 1,552 $ 1,163 37 % 27 % 33 % 20 % Worldwide $ 5,624 $ 3,476 $ 2,919 62 % 57 % 19 % 14 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Basis Basis Basis Basis Cardiovascular $ 4,107 $ 2,168 $ 1,797 89 % 84 % 21 % 15 % Electrophysiology 130 113 101 15 % 12 % 12 % 8 % Neurovascular 253 223 169 13 % 9 % 32 % 23 % Cardiovascular $ 4,490 $ 2,504 $ 2,067 79 % 74 % 21 % 15 % Oncology $ 186 $ 166 $ 143 12 % 8 % 16 % 12 % Endoscopy 641 580 513 11 % 7 % 13 % 8 % Urology 261 226 196 15 % 13 % 15 % 13 % Endosurgery $ 1,088 $ 972 $ 852 12 % 9 % 14 % 10 % Neuromodulation $ 46 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 5,624 $ 3,476 $ 2,919 62 % 57 % 19 % 14 % We manage our international operating regions and divisions on a constant currency basis, while market risk from currency exchange rate changes is managed at the corporate level. U.S. Net Sales In 2004, our U.S. net sales increased by $1,578 million, or 82 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to $1,570 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system. We launched the TAXUS stent system in the U.S. late in the first quarter of 2004. Declines in our bare metal stent revenue by $155 million to $59 million in 2004 partially offset this increase as physicians continued to convert the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents, including our TAXUS stent system. Sales from other products within our Cardiovascular division also increased by $49 million, or 5 percent, during 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions, including $37 million in sales from our Neuromodulation division. We established this division following our June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics. 21 Table of Contents In 2003, our U.S. net sales increased by $168 million, or 10 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to sales growth in our Cardiovascular division. Our coronary stent revenues in the U.S. increased in 2003 by $35 million, or 19 percent, due to sales of the Express2TM coronary stent system that we launched in September 2002. Sales from our other Cardiovascular products, including the Maverick coronary angioplasty balloon catheters and the FilterWire EX embolic protection device, also increased by $50 million, or 6 percent, as compared to 2002. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions. International Net Sales In 2004, our international net sales increased by $570 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $375 million, or 189 percent, in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. We launched the TAXUS stent system in these markets during the first quarter of 2003. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, none of which was individually significant. In 2004, our Japan net sales increased by $72 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2003 primarily due to $57 million in sales of our Express2 coronary stent system. We launched the Express2 coronary stent system in Japan during the first quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, one of our competitors launched its drug eluting stent in Japan. As a result, we experienced declining coronary stent sales in Japan throughout the second half of 2004. Until we launch our drug eluting stent in Japan, which we expect to occur late in 2006, we do not expect significant sales of our coronary stents in Japan. In 2003, our international net sales increased by $389 million, or 33 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to $198 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. The remainder of the increase in our net sales in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, including our ultrasound product line as well as peripheral vascular stents and balloons. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2004 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Gross profit 4,332 77.0 2,515 72.4 2,049 70.2 In 2004, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 4.6 percentage points as compared to 2003. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems in the U.S., increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 6.5 percentage points. This improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write downs, with $43 million of that amount attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and $14 million attributable to the write down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf life dating. In addition, other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2004 by approximately 1.0 percentage point. We anticipate that our gross profit will continue to increase during 2005 due to expected sales growth of higher margin products, including our TAXUS stent system. In 2003, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 2.2 percentage points as compared to 2002. Cost reductions resulting from prior year initiatives that related to plant network optimization, manufacturing process control and supply chain optimization increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 3.0 percentage points. In addition, shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily coronary stents, increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 1.3 percentage points. These improvements in gross profit were partially reduced by increased period expenses, including start up costs associated with TAXUS stent system production, which decreased gross profit as a percentage of our net sales by 1.0 percentage point. 22 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2004 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,742 31.0 1,171 33.7 1,002 34.3 Research and development expenses 569 10.1 452 13.0 343 11.8 Royalty expense 195 3.5 54 1.6 36 1.2 Amortization expense 112 2.0 89 2.6 72 2.5 Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expenses In 2004, our SGA expenses increased by $571 million, or 49 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to approximately $200 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher sales force commission expenses, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program, and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and $40 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, our SGA expenses in 2004 included charges of $110 million attributable to an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan and $90 million resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. Further, our SGA expenses included $40 million in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. As a percentage of our net sales, SGA expenses decreased to 31.0 percent in 2004 from 33.7 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. We anticipate that SGA expenses will continue to increase, but decrease as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions, due to expected revenue growth and our plan to continue to grow SGA spending at a slower rate than revenue. In 2003, our SGA expenses increased by $169 million, or 17 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to approximately $95 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher employee compensation, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program, and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and $45 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of our net sales, SGA expenses decreased to 33.7 percent in 2003 from 34.3 percent in 2002 primarily due to our efforts to control general and administrative expenses. Research and Development Expenses Our investment in research and development reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2004, our research and development expenses increased by $117 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $50 million in our Cardiovascular division, which was mainly associated with our next generation stent platforms. In addition, our research and development expenses in 2004 included $25 million attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. The remainder of the growth in our research and development spending reflects investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory infrastructure and provide additional funding for research and development on next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 13.0 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. In 2005, we expect to continue to invest aggressively in research and development and we expect research and development spending to remain at approximately 10 percent of our net sales in 2005. In 2003, our research and development expenses increased by $109 million, or 32 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses increased to 13.0 percent in 2003 from 11.8 percent in 2002. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of $55 million in our drug eluting stent franchise. In addition, in 2003, we increased our investment in certain other Cardiovascular projects by $15 million and in Endosurgery projects by $25 million. Royalty Expense In 2004, our royalty expense increased by $141 million, or 261 percent, as compared to 2003. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.5 percent in 2004 from 1.6 percent in 2003. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $137 million to $147 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. In November 2004, we exercised our right under an 23 Table of Contents existing licensing agreement with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Angiotech) to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field. In exchange for the exclusive license, we will pay Angiotech an additional royalty of one percentage point on certain future sales. We anticipate that royalty expense, as a percentage of our net sales, will increase to approximately 4 percent in 2005. In addition, we continue to enter strategic technological alliances, some of which include royalty commitments. In 2003, our royalty expense increased by $18 million, or 50 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense increased to 1.6 percent in 2003 from 1.2 percent in 2002. The increase related to sales growth of our royalty bearing products, including $10 million of royalty expense payable on sales of our TAXUS stent system. Amortization Expense In 2004, our amortization expense increased by $23 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions in 2004 of Advanced Bionics and Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. (PVS). Amortization expense for these two acquisitions was $17 million in 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense decreased to 2.0 percent in 2004 from 2.6 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. In 2003, our amortization expense increased by $17 million, or 24 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.6 percent in 2003 from 2.5 percent in 2002. The increase related primarily to amortization of intangible assets we acquired during 2003 and 2002. Interest Expense And Other, Net Our interest expense increased to $64 million in 2004 from $46 million in 2003 and $43 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market interest rates on our floating rate borrowings. Our other, net reflected expense of $16 million in 2004 and expense of $8 million in 2003. In 2004, our other, net included realized gains of $36 million from sales of investments that were offset by asset write downs of $58 million associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held companies. We do not believe that these write downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $20 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. Our interest income increased in 2004 due to growth in our overseas cash balances and our increased investment in securities with longer maturity dates. Our other, net reflected expense of $18 million in 2002, which included a donation of $18 million to fund the Boston Scientific Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to the advancement of healthcare and education. Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase/(Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 Reported tax rate 28.9 % 26.6 % 32.1 % 2.3 (5.5 ) Impact of certain charges* 4.9 % 1.6 % 3.1 % 3.3 (1.5 ) * These charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2004, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2003 related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during 2004 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we plan to repatriate in 2005 pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act; an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures; an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan; purchased research and development; and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. In addition, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions. Offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain of our non U.S. operations that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. In connection with this decision, we established a deferred tax liability of $86 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. 24 Table of Contents Management currently estimates that our 2005 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 24 percent. However, geographic changes in the manufacture of our products or future business acquisitions may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2003, the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2002 related primarily to the decrease in our purchased research and development charges to $37 million in 2003 from $85 million in 2002, which were not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, during 2003, we settled several audits and reduced our previous estimate for accrued taxes by $139 million to reflect the resolution of these audits. Further, as we generated more revenue from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions, our overall effective tax rate was favorably impacted. Offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain non U.S. operations. We established a deferred tax liability of $180 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. Litigation Related Charges and Credits In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures. In 2003, we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases. The cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was $8 million. In addition, during 2003, we recorded a $7 million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. In 2002, we recorded a favorable settlement with Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) of $175 million related to Medtronics rapid exchange stent delivery systems and angioplasty dilatation balloon catheters. In addition, we recorded a net charge of $76 million for settlements related to our rapid exchange catheter technology. Purchased Research and Development In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our April 2004 acquisition of PVS. The most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics bion microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in process projects value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including migraine headaches, urge incontinence, epilepsy and sleep apnea. The cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between $35 million and $45 million. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. The cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between $30 million and $40 million. As of the date we acquired Advanced Bionics, we expected the products to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within four years. In 2003, we recorded $37 million of purchased research and development. Our 2003 purchased research and development consisted of $9 million relating to our acquisition of InFlow Dynamics, Inc. (InFlow) and $28 million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years. The in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of InFlow were not significant to our consolidated results. The purchased research and development associated with the prior years acquisitions related primarily to our acquisition of Embolic Protection, Inc. (EPI) and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition, but earned during 2003. In 2002, we recorded $85 million of purchased research and development. Our 2002 purchased research and development related primarily to the acquisitions of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc. (EMT) and Smart Therapeutics, Inc. (Smart). The most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our 2002 acquisitions included EMTs ENTERYX Liquid Polymer Technology and Smarts atherosclerosis stent, which collectively represented 82 percent of our 2002 acquired in process projects value. ENTERYX is a patented liquid polymer for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms. During 2003, we completed the ENTERYX in process project and received FDA approval for this technology. The total cost for us to complete the project was $6 million. The atherosclerosis stent is a self expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain. We continue to pursue the development of Smarts atherosclerosis stent and believe we have a reasonable chance of completing the project. We have spent $7 million on this project as of December 31, 2004 and estimate additional costs of $1 million to complete the project. These estimates approximate our estimates at the time of acquisition. 25 Table of Contents Outlook In 2004, we increased our net sales by 62 percent, our reported net income by 125 percent and our cash provided by operating activities by 129 percent. This growth was primarily due to sales of our TAXUS stent system that was approved for sale in the U.S. on March 4, 2004. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will exceed $5 billion in 2005 and approximate $6 billion in 2006. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. Drug eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately 87 percent of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2005 and approximately 90 percent in 2006. Our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the U.S. market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market. We believe that we can maintain our leadership position within the drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including: the positive and consistent results of our TAXUS clinical trials; the performance benefits of our current technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; and our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. However, a material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: unexpected variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitions products; the timing of new competitive launches; the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies; litigation related to intellectual property; continued physician confidence in our technology; the average number of stents used per procedure; expansion of indications for use; and the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology. We recently announced nine month results from our TAXUS V clinical trial. TAXUS V expands on the TAXUS IV pivotal trial by studying a higher risk patient population, including patients with small vessels, large vessels and long lesions requiring multiple overlapping stents. The overall TAXUS V study met its primary endpoint of safety and efficacy as well as all secondary endpoints. In addition, stent thrombosis rates were virtually identical between the TAXUS stent and bare metal stents indicating comparable safety of drug eluting stents and bare metal stents. However, inconsistent clinical data from existing or future trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties may impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market. Our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the U.S. market. We expect our share of the drug eluting stent market as well as unit prices to be adversely impacted as additional competitors enter the drug eluting stent market, which we anticipate during 2005 internationally and during 2006 in the U.S. During the first quarter of 2005, we completed our initial launch of our next generation drug eluting stent product, the TAXUS Libert coronary stent system, in certain Inter Continental markets. We expect to launch the TAXUS Libert coronary stent system in Europe during 2005 and in the U.S. during 2006, subject to regulatory approval. In 2004, Johnson Johnson announced its intention to acquire Guidant Corporation (Guidant). Johnson Johnson and Guidant are two of our primary competitors in the coronary stent market and this acquisition may create increased volatility and uncertainty within the coronary stent market. In addition, during the second quarter of 2004, one of our competitors launched its drug eluting stent in Japan, which has converted rapidly to drug eluting stent technology. In order to receive regulatory approval of the TAXUS stent system in Japan, we were required during 2004 to conduct a small clinical trial using the TAXUS stent system with the antiplatelet therapy Ticlid. We currently expect to launch the TAXUS stent system in Japan late in 2006, subject to regulatory approval. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and recent government mandated, industry wide pricing reductions for medical devices in Japan, we believe that our operating income in Japan may be reduced by approximately $70 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Until we launch our drug eluting stent in Japan, it is likely that our Japan business will be subject to significant market share and price pressure. 26 Table of Contents There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors, including Johnson Johnson, Medtronic and Medinol Ltd. (Medinol). There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings. The manufacture of our TAXUS stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes. Inventory levels may be impacted by significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with the TAXUS stent manufacturing process. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges. In July and August, we announced the voluntary recalls of approximately 88,000 TAXUS Express2 stent systems and 11,000 Express2 stent systems, due to characteristics in the delivery catheters that had the potential to impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure. As a result of our investigation made in conjunction with the recalls, we implemented reviews of our manufacturing process, additional inspections and an FDA approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. We believe that these measures have been and continue to be effective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non deflation. In connection with the voluntary recalls described above, we recorded a sales return reserve of $35 million and an inventory write down of $43 million. The sales return reserve was established for all customer owned inventory that was subject to the recalls. We reversed the sales return reserve in the second half of 2004 upon the replacement of recalled units with new units to customers. The inventory write down related to inventory on consignment (i.e., inventory we owned) and inventory on hand at our facilities that was subject to the recalls. We placed the recalled inventory into quarantine upon receipt and we will scrap it when permitted by the FDA. We do not intend to sell the quarantined inventory. In October 2004, the FDA indicated that it would seek no further regulatory action regarding the recalls. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate these businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. In connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in process research and development platforms. As we continue to undertake strategic initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development platforms. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology. The inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions. Further, we anticipate increasing our focus and spending on internal research and development in areas outside of drug eluting stent technology. We believe our focus will be primarily on endoscopic systems, carotid stenting, vascular sealing, endovascular aortic repair, cardiac rhythm management, bifurcation stenting and neuromodulation. In addition, we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in strategic alliances and acquisitions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing, depending on their size and nature. International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our revenues and profits. 27 Table of Contents Further, the trend in countries around the world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more vigorous enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty, delay, greater risk and higher expenses. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing and documentation. A decision not to dedicate sufficient resources, or the failure to timely renew these approvals, may limit our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions. These factors may impact the rate at which we can grow. However, management believes that we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the markets we serve. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,296 $ 671 $ 260 Short term marketable securities 344 81 17 Cash provided by operating activities 1,804 787 736 Cash used for investing activities 1,622 871 485 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 439 487 (175 ) EBITDA* $ 1,813 $ 879 $ 748 * The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net income: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 1,062 $ 472 $ 373 Income taxes 432 171 176 Interest expense 64 46 43 Interest income (20 ) (6 ) (5 ) Depreciation and amortization 275 196 161 EBITDA $ 1,813 $ 879 $ 748 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre tax charges of $340 million in 2004, $52 million in 2003 and $33 million in 2002.2 Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth. The increase in cash generated by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in EBITDA offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities and certain tax related items. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to 2004 sales of our TAXUS stent system. A 2 The 2004 pre tax charges consisted of a provision for legal and regulatory exposures, an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, purchased research and development and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. The 2002 pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development, costs related to our global operations strategy that was substantially completed in 2002, a charitable donation to fund the Boston Scientific Foundation and special credits for net amounts received in connection with litigation settlements. 28 Table of Contents portion of the cash generated from these sales was invested in research and development projects and in our sales, clinical and manufacturing capabilities. Significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in 2004 included increases in cash flow of $364 million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses and $200 million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities as well as decreases in cash flow of $317 million attributable to trade accounts receivable and $57 million attributable to inventories. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related primarily to the enhancement we made to our 401(k) Plan in 2004; our provision for legal and regulatory exposures; royalty expense attributable to sales growth of royalty bearing products; and an increase in employee related accruals. A portion of these accounts payable and accrued expenses will be paid in the beginning of 2005. The increase in taxes payable and other liabilities related primarily to the increase in income taxes payable associated with our 2004 income growth. The increase in trade accounts receivable related primarily to our 2004 sales growth. The increase in inventories related primarily to our accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for the TAXUS stent system. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $274 million in 2004 as compared to $187 million in 2003. The increase related primarily to our spending of $55 million during 2004 for the purchase and build out of an office complex for our Endosurgery division in the U.S. The remainder of the increase was attributable to our capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $400 million during 2005, which includes further investments in our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, as well as our facility network. In 2002, we began investing our excess cash in short term marketable securities with maturity dates that exceeded 90 days in order to benefit from higher returns. In 2004, we purchased $660 million of these investments and we received $397 million from maturities of our short term marketable securities. Our investing activities during 2004 also included $729 million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics; $75 million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of PVS; $107 million of acquisition related payments associated with EPI, Smart and InFlow; and $272 million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies. These payments were offset by $98 million of cash proceeds from sales of privately held and publicly traded equity securities. In March 2005, we acquired Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST), a developer of stent delivery systems that are designed to address coronary artery disease in bifurcated vessels. In conjunction with the acquisition of AST, we will pay approximately $120 million in shares of our common stock plus future consideration that is contingent upon AST achieving certain milestones. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long term public debt issuances, repayment of short term borrowings, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. The following table provides a summary at December 31 of our net debt: (in millions) 2004 2003 Short term debt $ 1,228 $ 553 Long term debt 1,139 1,172 Gross debt $ 2,367 $ 1,725 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,640 752 Net debt $ 727 $ 973 We had outstanding borrowings of $2,367 million at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 3.38 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $1,725 million at December 31, 2003 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.96 percent. During 2004, we received net proceeds from borrowings of $577 million. We used proceeds from debt issuances principally to fund our acquisitions and other strategic alliances. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily relate to our non U.S. operations. In October 2004, the U.S. enacted the American Jobs Creation Act. The American Jobs Creation Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income 29 Table of Contents earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Although the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act, we believe that we have made an informed decision on the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act on our repatriation plans. Based on that decision, we plan to repatriate $1,046 million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act during the first quarter of 2005 and accordingly have recorded a tax liability of $61 million as of December 31, 2004. In 2004, we repatriated earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries for which we had previously accrued tax liabilities. Our resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were $33 million. In addition, we established deferred tax liabilities of $86 million for additional amounts we plan to repatriate from certain of our non U.S. operations that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. The tax liability we accrued for earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future is $233 million at December 31, 2004. Borrowings and Credit Arrangements Revolving Credit Facilities: As of December 31, 2003, our credit facilities totaled $1,220 million. During 2004, we refinanced and increased our credit facilities, which totaled $2,185 million as of December 31, 2004. Our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2004 consisted of a $1,624 million credit facility that terminates in May 2009; a $541 million credit facility that terminates in May 2005 and contains an option to convert into a one year term loan maturing in May 2006; and a $20 million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in June 2005. Our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured. Our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program. We had $280 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.44 percent and $1,003 million outstanding at December 31, 2003 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.20 percent. In addition, we had 45 billion Japanese yen (translated to $439 million) of credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.37 percent at December 31, 2004 as compared to no outstanding Japanese yen revolving credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2003. We have a revolving credit and security facility that is secured by our U.S. trade receivables and provides $400 million of borrowing capacity. During 2004, we increased the facility borrowing capacity from $200 million to $400 million and extended the maturity to August 2005. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of our eligible receivables, concentration of our eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity, which we consolidate. This entity purchases our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings remain on our balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable net, while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit and security facility as compared to $194 million of outstanding borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 1.44 percent at December 31, 2003. In addition, we had uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 15 billion Japanese yen (translated to $145 million) at December 31, 2004 and up to 14.6 billion Japanese yen (translated to $136 million) at December 31, 2003. Approximately $128 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2004 and $113 million were discounted at an average interest rate of 1.38 percent at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we intended to repay all of our short term debt obligations within the next twelve month period. As of December 31, 2003, we had the ability and intent to refinance a portion of our short term debt on a long term basis through our revolving credit facilities and expected that a minimum of $650 million of our short term obligations, including $456 million of our commercial paper and $194 million of our revolving credit and security facility borrowings, would remain outstanding beyond a twelve month period. Accordingly, at December 31, 2003, we classified $650 million of our short term borrowings as long term borrowings. Senior Notes: We had senior notes of $1,600 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 and $500 million outstanding at December 31, 2003. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had $500 million of senior notes outstanding that we will repay in March 2005 (March 2005 Notes) upon maturity. The March 2005 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 6.625 percent, are not redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. 30 Table of Contents In June 2004, we issued $600 million of senior notes due June 2014 (June 2014 Notes) under a public registration statement previously filed with the SEC. The June 2014 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 5.45 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. In November 2004, we filed a public registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to $1,500 million in various debt and equity securities. Under this public registration statement, we issued $250 million of senior notes due January 2011 (January 2011 Notes) and $250 million of senior notes due January 2017 (January 2017 Notes). The January 2011 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 4.25 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. The January 2017 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 5.125 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of all of our senior notes. We have recorded changes in the fair value of our senior notes since entering the interest rate swaps. We recorded interest payments or receipts under the interest rate swap agreements as interest expense. For our March 2005 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six month LIBOR plus 4.1 percentage points, which approximated 6.9 percent at December 31, 2004 and 5.3 percent at December 31, 2003. For our June 2014 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six month LIBOR, which approximated 2.8 percent at December 31, 2004. For our January 2011 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six month LIBOR minus approximately 0.1 percentage point and for our January 2017 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six month LIBOR plus approximately 0.17 percentage points. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of our June 2014 Notes included $32 million of unrealized gains that we recorded as other long term assets to recognize the fair value of the interest rate swap. The fair values of our other interest rate swaps were immaterial at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Equity In 2004, we repurchased approximately 10 million of our own shares at an aggregate cost of $360 million. In addition, during 2004, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The new authorization is in addition to approximately 13 million shares remaining under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Our available cash and cash equivalents, future operating cash flow and credit facilities will fund our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we have repurchased approximately 107 million shares of our common stock under these authorizations and we have 9 million shares of our common stock in our treasury at year end. During the first quarter of 2005, we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock. We may repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of 2005 depending on market conditions. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including strategic alliances and acquisitions. During 2004, we received $225 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments. See Notes D, F and G to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business combinations, long term debt and lease arrangements. 31 Table of Contents Payments Due by Period 1 Year 2 3 4 5 After 5 (in millions) or Less Years Years Years Total Debt* $ 1,228 $ 4 $ 3 $ 1,102 $ 2,337 Operating leases 45 58 15 3 121 Purchase obligations, 115 14 3 132 Minimum royalty obligations 3 8 3 6 20 Total $ 1,391 $ 84 $ 24 $ 1,111 $ 2,610 * Debt as reported in our consolidated balance sheets includes the mark to market effect of our interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. We accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. We accounted for the business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. We accounted for the business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. For acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001, we allocate these payments, if made, to specific intangible asset categories, including purchased research and development, and assign the remainder to goodwill as if we had paid the consideration at the date of acquisition. For acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001, we allocate these payments, if made, to goodwill. Payment of the additional consideration is generally contingent upon the acquired companies reaching certain performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. In 2004, we recorded amounts for acquisition related obligations primarily as an adjustment to goodwill. Of the amounts recorded for acquisition related obligations in 2003, we recorded $24 million as an adjustment to purchased research and development, $9 million as an adjustment to other identifiable intangible asset categories, net of the related deferred tax liabilities, and we recorded the remainder as an adjustment to goodwill. Certain earn out payments are based on multiples of the acquired companys revenue during the earn out period and, consequently, we cannot currently determine the total payments. However, we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn out obligation. At December 31, 2004, the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately $3.1 billion, some of which may be payable in our common stock. The milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from 2005 through 2013. The estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately $7.0 billion. Since it is not possible to estimate when the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Further, during 2005, we expect to exercise our options to purchase certain strategic alliances for approximately $300 million, some of which may be payable in our common stock. 32 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A of our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates are considered critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider to be critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single use disposable medical devices. Revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, which indicates that the sale is complete. We generally allow our customers to return defective or damaged products for credit. Our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue, with the corresponding liability being classified as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information that can be used to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventories We state inventories at the lower of first in, first out cost or market. Our provisions for excess or expired inventory are primarily based on managements estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. We record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales. Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in a business combination under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful lives could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these projects in conjunction with the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects. We use the income approach to establish the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach establishes fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of 33 Table of Contents the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: in 2004, 18 percent to 27 percent; in 2003, 24 percent; and in 2002, 17 percent to 26 percent. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets We record intangible assets at historical cost. We amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization, including patents, licenses, developed technology and core technology, using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We review these intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. We also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the related carrying values. We test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. Investments in Strategic Alliances As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in 58 strategic alliances totaling $529 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had investments in 61 strategic alliances totaling $558 million. These assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities. We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have significant influence over an investment requires judgment. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include a significant deterioration in earnings performance; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee; and a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary, we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments, notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances. As of December 31, 2004, we held investments totaling $61 million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 25 percent to 30 percent. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating $18 million at December 31, 2004 and net deferred tax assets aggregating $94 million at December 31, 2003. The liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future. The assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe these assets will be substantially recovered. See Note J of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. 34 Table of Contents We have provided for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are $1,005 million at December 31, 2004 and $1,184 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit. Stock Option Modifications During the fourth quarter, we modified certain of our stock option plans, principally for options granted prior to May 2001, to change the definition of retirement to conform to the definition generally used in our stock option plans subsequent to May 2001. As a result of these modifications, we recorded a $90 million charge ($60 million after tax) in 2004. The key assumptions in estimating the charge were the anticipated retirement age and the expected exercise patterns for the individuals whose options were modified. If our assumptions do not approximate actual retirement behavior and exercise activity, we may need to record adjustments through our statements of operations. Legal Costs We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue costs of settlement, damages and, under certain conditions, costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable. Otherwise, these costs are expensed as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for regulatory and litigation related costs that were probable and estimable was $99 million at December 31, 2004 and $16 million at December 31, 2003. See further discussion of our legal proceedings in Item 3, Legal Proceedings above. Product Liability Costs We are substantially self insured with respect to general and product liability claims. In the normal course of business, product liability claims are asserted against us. We accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability claims based on historical experience, or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. We record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. Our accrual for product liability claims was $13 million at December 31, 2004 and $15 million at December 31, 2003. Product liability claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. The absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, based on product liability losses experienced in the past, our election to become substantially self insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations. Management believes that our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general and product liability losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. New Accounting Standard On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In general, Statement No. 123(R) contains similar accounting concepts as those described in Statement No. 123. However, Statement No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. We expect to adopt Statement No. 123(R) when it becomes effective as of July 1, 2005. Statement No. 123(R) permits public companies to adopt the new requirements using one of two methods: 1. A modified prospective method in that compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date of Statement No. 123(R) and (b) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123 for all awards granted to employees before July 1, 2005 that remain unvested as of July 1, 2005. 35 Table of Contents 2. A modified retrospective method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under Statement No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or (b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating which method we will use to adopt the requirements of Statement No. 123(R). As permitted by Statement No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options, except as disclosed in Note M of our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement No. 123(R)s fair value method will impact our statements of operations. The impact of adoption of Statement No. 123(R) cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future and the method used to value such awards. However, had we adopted Statement No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature. This requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after our adoption of Statement No. 123(R). While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows we recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $185 million in 2004, $154 million in 2003 and $28 million in 2002. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Lawrence C. Best President and Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over 36 Table of Contents financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated March 10, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 10, 2005 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily foreign currency denominated borrowings) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $4,171 million at December 31, 2004 and $1,724 million at December 31, 2003. The increase is due to hedging forecasted increases in earnings and cash flows denominated primarily in Japanese yen and euro and to changes in our Japanese subsidiary structure. We recorded $70 million of other assets and $129 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 as compared to $15 million of other assets and $84 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2003. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $163 million at December 31, 37 Table of Contents 2004 and by $105 million at December 31, 2003. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $190 million at December 31, 2004 and by $128 million at December 31, 2003. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or cash flow. Our earnings and cash flow exposure to interest rate changes on U.S. dollar and Japanese yen denominated debt is partially offset by interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting floating rate debt into fixed rate debt or fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $1,600 million at December 31, 2004 and $500 million at December 31, 2003. We recorded $32 million of other assets and $1 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 as compared to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2003. A one percent increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $84 million at December 31, 2004 as compared to $7 million at December 31, 2003. A one percent decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $92 million at December 31, 2004 as compared to $7 million at December 31, 2003. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability in Item 7 above. 38 Table of Contents
