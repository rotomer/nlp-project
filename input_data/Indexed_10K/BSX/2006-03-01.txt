ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, vascular surgery, electrophysiology, neurovascular intervention, oncology, endoscopy, urology, gynecology and neuromodulation. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2005 and focuses on the impact of drug eluting stents to our operations. In addition, our executive summary will discuss the significance of the proposed Guidant Corporation acquisition to our future growth. Following the executive summary is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2005 as compared to 2004 and our operating results for 2004 as compared to 2003. The operating results are supplemented by an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects, including the proposed acquisition of Guidant. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. In addition, we will highlight the impact of the potential Guidant acquisition on our future liquidity. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical accounting policies. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2005 increased to $6,283 million from $5,624 million in 2004, an increase of 12 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $25 million of foreign currency fluctuations, our net sales increased 11 percent. Our gross profit increased to $4,897 million, or 77.9 percent of net sales, in 2005 from $4,332 million, or 77.0 percent of net sales, in 2004. Our reported net income for 2005 was $628 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, as compared to $1,062 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, in 2004. Our reported results included net after tax charges of $894 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in 2005 as compared to net after tax charges of $332 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in 2004.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $903 million in 2005, which includes $750 million paid for the Medinol settlement, as compared to $1,804 million in 2004. The growth in 2005 resulted largely from a full year of sales of our TAXUS&reg; Express2 paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the United States in March 2004 and increased sales of the TAXUS stent system in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. TAXUS stent sales in 2005 were $2,556 million as compared $2,143 million in 2004, an increase of 19 percent. We have achieved and maintained leading drug eluting stent market positions within our U.S., Europe 1The 2005 net after tax charges consisted of a $598 million litigation settlement with Medinol Ltd.; $267 million in purchased research and development primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions; $24 million of asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; $11 million in expenses related to certain retirement benefits; and a $6 million tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. The 2004 net after tax charges consisted of a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures; a $71 million enhancement to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan; $65 million of purchased research and development; a $61 million charge relating to taxes on the approximately $1 billion of cash that we repatriated in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and a $60 million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. 35 and Inter Continental markets. Further, due to increased penetration rates and the successful launch of our next generation TAXUS&reg; Libert&eacute; paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system in our Europe and Inter Continental markets, our international TAXUS stent system sales for 2005 increased by 38 percent as compared to 2004. This increase in sales was offset by decreased TAXUS stent system sales in the U.S. during the second half of 2005, as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We expect to launch our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in the U.S. in the second half of 2006 and our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan in the first half of 2007, subject to regulatory approvals. In addition, during 2005, our worldwide Endosurgery group sales increased to $1,228 million from $1,088 million in 2004, an increase of 13 percent. Further, our Neuromodulation division, formed following the June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, generated $148 million in net sales during 2005 as compared to $46 million in 2004, which represents the period following the acquisition. During 2005, we invested a portion of our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives, particularly related to our 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics and our 2005 acquisition of TriVascular, Inc., as well as on projects within our Endosurgery group, including our Endovations Endoscopy Suite. We funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2005. In addition, due to favorable market conditions, we raised $750 million from the public markets through a November 2005 debt offering. We used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuance to: repay short term debt obligations; repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market; and fund 2005 strategic alliances and acquisitions. Recent Developments On January 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $27 billion (net of proceeds from option exercises), which represents a combination of cash and stock worth $80 per share of Guidant common stock. We expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high growth cardiac rhythm management business, significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories has agreed to acquire Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug eluting stent technology it acquires from Guidant with us. This will enable us to access a second drug eluting stent program that will complement our existing TAXUS stent program. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearances under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the European Union merger control regulation, as well as approval of Boston Scientific and Guidant shareholders. Subject to these conditions, we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of April 3, 2006. On January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As also stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval applications for our class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected. We intend to resolve the quality issues 36 cited by the FDA prior to the anticipated launch of our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in the United States and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product. However, while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA, and any such resolution may require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources. In addition, if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including but not limited to seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties.

The increase primarily related to $1,763 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system for 2005 as compared to $1,570 million for 2004. We launched our TAXUS stent system in the U.S. late in the first quarter of 2004 and estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 88 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents as of December 31, 2005, as compared to 85 percent at December 31, 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. This increase in sales was offset by decreased TAXUS stent system sales in the U.S. during the second half of 2005, as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. In 2004, our U.S. net sales increased by $1,578 million, or 82 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to $1,570 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system. Declines in our bare metal stent revenue by $155 million to $59 million in 2004 partially offset this increase, as physicians continued to convert the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents, including our TAXUS stent system. Sales from other products within our Cardiovascular division also increased by $49 million, or five percent, during 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions, including $37 million in sales from our Neuromodulation division. International Net Sales In 2005, our international net sales increased by $309 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $220 million, or 38 percent, in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. As of December 31, 2005, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter Continental markets have converted approximately 49 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents, as compared to approximately 40 percent at the end of 2004. Conversion rates have been more gradual in these markets than in the U.S. primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels. In addition, we successfully launched our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in certain Inter Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $57 million in incremental sales from our Endosurgery group, and $27 million in sales growth from our Neuromodulation division. In 2005, our Japan net sales decreased by $34 million, or six percent, as compared to 2004 primarily due to decreased sales from our Cardiovascular division. We have experienced declining coronary stent sales in Japan since a competitor launched its drug eluting stent in this market late in the second quarter of 2004. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and government mandated pricing reductions for other products, we do not expect revenue growth in our existing Japan business until we receive regulatory approval and launch our drug eluting stent in Japan, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2007. In 2004, our international net sales increased by $570 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of $155 million of foreign currency fluctuations, international net sales increased 27 percent. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $375 million, or 189 percent, in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. We launched the TAXUS stent system in these markets during the first quarter of 2003. In addition, in 2004 our Japan net sales increased by $72 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2003 primarily due to sales of our Express2 38 stent system, which we launched in Japan during the first quarter of 2004. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, none of which were individually significant. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Gross profit 4,897 77.9 4,332 77.0 2,515 72.4 In 2005, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.9 percentage points as compared to 2004. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems, increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Our gross profit percentage increased by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write downs in 2004, including a $43 million write down attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and a $14 million write down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf life dating. Our gross profit for 2005 was reduced as a percentage of net sales by 0.9 percentage points related to period expenses, including manufacturing start up costs primarily associated with our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system and increased investment in quality initiatives. The remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In 2004, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 4.6 percentage points as compared to 2003. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems in the U.S., increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 6.5 percentage points. This improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write downs. In addition, other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2004 by approximately 1.0 percentage point. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,814 28.9 1,742 31.0 1,171 33.7 Research and development expenses 680 10.8 569 10.1 452 13.0 Royalty expense 227 3.6 195 3.5 54 1.6 Amortization expense 152 2.4 112 2.0 89 2.6 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2005, our SG&A expenses increased by $72 million, or four percent, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily related to: approximately $100 million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our Interventional Cardiology business unit and Endosurgery group and costs related to market development initiatives; $75 million in incremental operating expenses associated with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily 39 Advanced Bionics; $21 million in employee related costs primarily attributable to optimization initiatives within our human resources function and international divisions; $19 million in stock compensation expense primarily associated with the issuance of deferred stock units in 2005; and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. Certain charges incurred in 2004 partially offset these increases, including a $110 million enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, and a $90 million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 28.9 percent in 2005 from 31.0 percent in 2004 primarily due to the increase in our net sales in 2005. In 2004, our SG&A expenses increased by $571 million, or 49 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase primarily related to: approximately $200 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher sales force commission expenses, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and approximately $40 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, our SG&A expenses in 2004 included charges of $110 million attributable to an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan and $90 million resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. Further, our SG&A expenses included $40 million in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 31.0 percent in 2004 from 33.7 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Research and Development Expenses Our investment in research and development reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2005, our research and development expenses increased by $111 million, or 20 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses increased to 10.8 percent in 2005 from 10.1 percent in 2004. The increase primarily related to approximately $60 million in incremental research and development expenses attributable to our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics and TriVascular. In addition, we increased spending on internal research and development projects within our Endosurgery group by $25 million, including increased spending on our Endovations Endoscopy Suite. In 2004, our research and development expenses increased by $117 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $50 million in our Cardiovascular division, which was mainly associated with our next generation stent platforms. In addition, our research and development expenses in 2004 included $25 million attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. The remainder of the growth in our research and development spending reflects investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory infrastructure and provide additional funding for research and development on next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 13.0 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Royalty Expense In 2005, our royalty expense increased by $32 million, or 16 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.6 percent in 2005 from 3.5 percent in 2004. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $27 million to $174 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. In 2004, our royalty expense increased by $141 million, or 261 percent, as compared to 2003. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.5 percent in 2004 from 1.6 percent in 2003. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products, primarily sales of 40 our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $137 million to $147 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. In November 2004, we exercised our right under an existing licensing agreement with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field. Amortization Expense In 2005, our amortization expense increased by $40 million, or 36 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.4 percent in 2005 from 2.0 percent in 2004. The increase in our amortization expense was primarily due to $25 million in incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in conjunction with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics. In addition, our amortization expense included a $10 million write off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx&reg; Liquid Polymer Technology (Enteryx), a discontinued technology platform obtained as a part of our acquisition of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc. The write off resulted from our decision during the third quarter of 2005 to cease selling the Enteryx product. In 2004, our amortization expense increased by $23 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions in 2004 of Advanced Bionics and Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. (PVS). Amortization expense for these two acquisitions was $17 million in 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense decreased to 2.0 percent in 2004 from 2.6 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Interest Expense and Other, Net Our interest expense increased to $90 million in 2005 from $64 million in 2004 and $46 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to an increase in average market interest rates on our borrowings. The increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market rates on our floating rate borrowings. Our other, net reflected income of $13 million in 2005, expense of $16 million in 2004, and expense of $8 million in 2003. Our other, net included asset write downs of $17 million in 2005 and $58 million in 2004 associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held and publicly traded companies. We do not believe that these write downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations. In 2004, our other, net included realized gains of $36 million from sales of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $36 million in 2005, $20 million in 2004, and $6 million in 2003. Our interest income increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increases in average market interest rates. Our interest income in 2004 increased as compared to 2003 due primarily to growth in our cash balances. Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase 2005 2004 2003 2005 versus 2004 2004 versus 2003 Reported tax rate 29.5 % 28.9 % 26.6 % 0.6 2.3 Impact of certain charges 5.5 % 4.9 % 1.6 % 0.6 3.3 In 2005, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2004 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2005 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These 41 charges include: certain litigation related charges; purchased research and development; asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; costs related to certain retirement benefits; and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Management currently estimates that our 2006 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 23 percent primarily due to our intention to reinvest substantially all of our offshore earnings. However, geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2004, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2003 related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during 2004 that were taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included: a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we repatriated in 2005 pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act; an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures; an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan; purchased research and development; and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. In addition, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions. Litigation Related Charges and Credits In 2005, we recorded a $780 million pre tax charge associated with the Medinol litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in Medinol. In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included the civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which was paid in the second quarter of 2005. In 2003, we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases. The cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was $8 million. In addition, during 2003, we recorded a $7 million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. Purchased Research and Development In 2005, we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005 purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to our acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST); $45 million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation; and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular Systems, Inc. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our strategic partners, is currently developing. This technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimers disease and other neurological conditions. The most significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included TriVasculars abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) stent graft and ASTs Petal bifurcation stent, which collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 purchased research and development. TriVasculars AAA stent graft design reduces the size of the stent graft by replacing much of the metal stent assembly with a polymer that is injected into channels within the stent graft during the procedure. During the fourth quarter of 2005, management decided to re design certain aspects of the stent graft to enhance patient safety and to improve product performance. The re design will result in incremental costs and time to complete 42 the project relative to those expected at the date of acquisition. We currently expect to launch the AAA stent graft in the U.S. by 2011 and to incur approximately $200 million of research and development costs over the next five years to complete the project. We continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities within this market, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval. ASTs Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel when a single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate the cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between $100 million and $125 million. As of the date we acquired AST, we expected the Petal bifurcation stent to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within six years in a drug eluting configuration. In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our acquisition of PVS. The most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics bion&reg; microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in process projects value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including migraine headaches and urge incontinence. The cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between $35 million and $45 million. We expect that the bion microstimulator will be commercially available within three years. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. The cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between $30 million and $40 million. We continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities for the drug delivery pump, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval. In 2003, we recorded $37 million of purchased research and development. Our 2003 purchased research and development consisted of $9 million relating to our acquisition of InFlow Dynamics, Inc. and $28 million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years. The in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of InFlow were not significant to our consolidated results. The purchased research and development associated with the prior years acquisitions related primarily to our 2001 acquisition of Embolic Protection, Inc. and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition, but earned during 2003. In connection with our 2002 acquisitions, we acquired several in process projects, including Smart Therapeutics, Inc.s atherosclerosis stent. The atherosclerosis stent is a self expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain. During 2005, we completed the atherosclerosis stent in process project and received Humanitarian Device Exemption approval to begin selling this technology on a limited basis. The total cost for us to complete the project was approximately $10 million. In connection with our 2001 acquisitions, we acquired several significant in process projects, including Interventional Technologies, Inc.s next generation Cutting Balloon&reg; device. The Cutting Balloon device is a novel balloon angioplasty device with mounted scalpels that relieve stress in the artery, reducing the force necessary to expand the vessel. During 2005, we completed the Cutting Balloon in process project and received FDA approval for this technology. The total cost for us to complete the project was approximately $7 million. 43  Outlook Coronary Stents Coronary stent revenue represented 43 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2005, and approximated $2,693 million in 2005 as compared to $2,351 million in 2004. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will approximate $6 billion in 2006, as compared to $5.9 billion in 2005. Drug eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately 87 percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2005 and 90 percent in 2006. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, we believe that the U.S. stent market has been substantially penetrated and estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 88 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents. We have experienced declines in our U.S. drug eluting stent revenues in the second half of 2005 as compared to the same period in the prior year largely as a result of a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We expect to launch our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in the U.S. during the second half of 2006, subject to regulatory approval. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter Continental markets have converted approximately 49 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents, as compared to approximately 40 percent at the end of 2004. We expect that conversion rates will continue to increase in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. We successfully launched our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in certain Inter Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. We believe our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system represents a driver of future revenue in these markets. Further, we expect to launch our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan during the first half of 2007, subject to regulatory approval, where we estimate the size of the market in 2007 to approximate $700 million. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the markets perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons, including: the positive and consistent results of our TAXUS clinical trials; the performance benefits of our current technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; and our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. A material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: entry of additional competitors in international markets and the U.S.; 44 declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems; variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitions products; new competitive product launches; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies; litigation related to intellectual property; continued physician confidence in our technology; the average number of stents used per procedure; expansion of indications for use; a reduction in the overall number of procedures performed; the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology; and the level of supply of our drug eluting stent system and competitive stent systems. Our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the U.S. market. Our share of the drug eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, are expected to continue to be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug eluting stent market, which began during the third quarter of 2005 internationally and is expected to occur during the second half of 2007 in the U.S. The manufacture of our TAXUS stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes. Significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with our TAXUS stent manufacturing process may impact our inventory levels. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges. Regulatory Compliance The trend in countries around the world, including the U.S. and Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk and expense. On January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As also stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval applications for our class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected. We intend to resolve the quality issues cited by the FDA prior to the anticipated launch of our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in the United States and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product. However, while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA, and any such resolution will likely require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources. In addition, if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including but not limited to seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties. Intellectual Property Litigation There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market and medical device industry. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our 45 objectives in the market. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note J Commitments and Contingencies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of these legal proceedings. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions. We successfully launched our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in certain Inter Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. We expect to launch our TAXUS Libert&eacute; stent system in the U.S. during the second half of 2006, subject to regulatory approval. Further, we anticipate continuing our increased focus and spending on areas outside of drug eluting stent technology. We believe our focus will be primarily on technologies in which we have already made significant investments, including neuromodulation, endoscopic systems, carotid stenting, and bifurcation stenting, but may also extend into other medical device opportunities. However, given their early stage of development, there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce funding of these projects may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth. Our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing, depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in selective strategic alliances and acquisitions. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. Our agreement to distribute certain guidewire and sheath products will expire during the first quarter of 2006. Management has identified some replacements for these products. The sales level associated with the replacement products is expected to be less than that of our previously distributed products. International Markets International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency fluctuations, 46 regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing and documentation. If sufficient resources are not available to renew these approvals or these approvals are not timely renewed, our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited. Guidant Acquisition On January 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $27 billion (net of proceeds from option exercises), which represents a combination of cash and stock worth $80 per share of Guidant common stock. We expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high growth cardiac rhythm management business, significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories has agreed to acquire Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug eluting stent technology it acquires from Guidant with us. This will enable us to access a second drug eluting stent program that will complement our existing TAXUS coronary stent program. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearances under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the European Union merger control regulation, as well as approval of Boston Scientific and Guidant shareholders. Subject to these conditions, we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of April 3, 2006. In connection with the acquisition, Boston Scientific will issue to Guidant shareholders and Abbott shares of Boston Scientific common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares, current Boston Scientific stockholders will own a smaller percentage of Boston Scientific after the acquisition. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, to increase from approximately 840 million for 2005 to approximately 1.4 billion following the acquisition. The acquisition will also result in significant dilution to our 2006 earnings per share. The integration of Guidants operations and product lines with Boston Scientific will be complex and time consuming, and the separation of the Guidant businesses required by the Abbott transaction will add complexity to the transition process. The failure to integrate Boston Scientific and Guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process successfully, including the retention of key Guidant personnel, may result in the combined company and its stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the combined company will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the acquisition as Boston Scientific integrates certain operations of Guidant. Although Boston Scientific and Guidant expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger related and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. Completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, and any extension of the waiting period, under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and approval under the European Union merger control regulation. These consents, orders and approvals may impose conditions on, or require divestitures relating to, the divisions, operations or assets of Boston Scientific or Guidant, in addition to the purchase by Abbott of Guidants vascular and endovascular businesses, and could require modification to the terms of the Abbott transaction agreement in a manner adverse to Boston Scientific or the combined company. These conditions or divestitures may jeopardize or delay completion of the Abbott 47 transaction or the acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Abbott transaction or the acquisition. Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement. Additionally, completion of the acquisition is conditioned on the absence of certain restraining orders or injunctions by judgment, court order or law that would restrain or prohibit consummation of the acquisition. Boston Scientific and Guidant have received recent claims related to the acquisition from plaintiffs seeking an injunction to prohibit consummation of the acquisition and other relief, including monetary damages. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 689 $ 1,296 $ 671 Short term marketable securities 159 344 81 Cash provided by operating activities 903 1,804 787 Cash used for investing activities 551 1,622 871 Cash (used for) provided by financing activities (954 ) 439 487 EBITDA* 1,259 1,813 879 *The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net income: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 628 $ 1,062 $ 472 Income taxes 263 432 171 Interest expense 90 64 46 Interest income (36 ) (20 ) (6 ) Depreciation and amortization 314 275 196 EBITDA $ 1,259 $ 1,813 $ 879 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre tax charges of $1,112 million in 2005, $340 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003.2 2The 2005 pre tax charges consisted of a litigation settlement with Medinol; purchased research and development; costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; and expenses related to certain retirement benefits. The 2004 pre tax charges consisted of a provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, purchased research and development and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. 48 Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth. The decrease in cash generated by our operating activities in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the decrease in EBITDA and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in EBITDA in 2005 as compared to 2004 reflects our third quarter 2005 settlement with Medinol, which was partially offset by increased sales of our TAXUS stent system during 2005. We invested a portion of the cash from sales of our TAXUS stent system in our sales, clinical and manufacturing capabilities, and in research and development projects. Significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in 2005 included decreases in cash flow of: $162 million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses; $77 million attributable to inventories; $59 million attributable to prepaid expenses and other assets; and $45 million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 related to our $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the Department of Justice, and our one time $110 million 401(k) contribution, which were both paid during June 2005. The increase in inventories in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to the accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for our TAXUS stent system and our Neuromodulation products. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to the establishment of a tax related receivable. The decrease in taxes payable and other liabilities in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily related to $350 million in tax payments made during 2005 including those associated with cash repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act and to the expected tax benefit associated with the settlement agreement with Medinol. The decrease in taxes payable in 2005 as compared to 2004 was partially offset by the increase in taxes payable associated with our 2005 earnings. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $341 million in 2005 as compared to $274 million in 2004. The increase primarily related to capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $400 million during 2006 (excluding Guidant), which includes additional capital expenditures to allow further growth in our Endosurgery group and Neuromodulation division, and certain business optimization initiatives in our human resources function, primarily outsourcing costs. Our investing activities during 2005 also included: $178 million of net payments primarily attributable to our acquisitions of Rubicon, TriVascular and CryoVascular; $33 million of acquisition earn out payments primarily associated with prior acquisitions; and $208 million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long term public debt issuances; repayment of short term borrowings; payments for share repurchases; and proceeds from option exercises related to our equity incentive programs. 49 The following table provides a summary at December 31 of our net debt: (in millions) 2005 2004 Short term debt $ 156 $ 1,228 Long term debt 1,864 1,139 Gross debt $ 2,020 $ 2,367 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 848 1,640 Net debt $ 1,172 $ 727 We had outstanding borrowings of $2,020 million at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.80 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $2,367 million at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 3.38 percent. During 2005, we made net payments on borrowings of $313 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held by our non U.S. operations. In 2005, we repatriated approximately $1,046 million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act from our non U.S. operations. The American Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. As of December 31, 2004, we had recorded a tax liability of $61 million for the amounts we intended to repatriate in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2005, we repatriated earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. The resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were $127 million. In addition, during 2005, we made a decision to repatriate additional amounts from certain of our non U.S. operations. In connection with this decision, we established a deferred tax liability of $27 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. Borrowings and Credit Arrangements Revolving Credit Facilities During 2005, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities to extend the maturity of one credit facility and to reduce borrowing capacity by $165 million. At December 31, 2005, our revolving credit facilities totaled approximately $2,020 million, as compared to $2,185 million at December 31, 2004. Our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2005 consisted of a $1,500 million credit facility that terminates in May 2009; a $500 million credit facility that terminates in May 2010 and contains an option to increase the facility size by an additional $500 million in the future; and a $20 million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in May 2006. Our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured. Our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program. We had $149 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.11 percent and $280 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.44 percent. In September 2005, we repaid 45 billion Japanese yen (approximately $400 million) in credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.37 percent. During 2005, we decreased our credit and security facility that is secured by our U.S. trade receivables from $400 million to $100 million, effective April 30, 2005. During the first quarter of 2006, we expect to increase this facility from $100 million to $350 million. The credit and security facility terminates in August 2006. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables, concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant changes 50 in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity, which is consolidated. This entity purchases our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings remain on the balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable, net, while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit and security facility as of December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2004. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 15 billion Japanese yen (translated to $127 million at December 31, 2005 and $145 million at December 31, 2004). Approximately $109 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2005 and $128 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we intended to repay all of our short term debt obligations within the next twelve month period. Senior Notes We had senior notes of $1,850 million outstanding at December 31, 2005 and $1,600 million outstanding at December 31, 2004. In November 2005, we issued $400 million of senior notes due November 2015 (November 2015 Notes) and $350 million of senior notes due November 2035 (November 2035 Notes) under a $1,500 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in November 2004. The November 2015 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 5.50 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. The November 2035 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 6.25 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These are publicly registered securities. In December 2005, we announced our intent to supplement the terms of our November 2015 Notes and November 2035 Notes to provide for a potential interest rate adjustment accruing from November 17, 2005 on each series of these senior notes in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded as a result of the closing of our proposed acquisition of Guidant. The interest rate on these senior notes will be subject to a one time increase based on our initial credit ratings. Based on preliminary indications from the rating agencies, we expect that the interest rate on each of our November 2015 Notes and our November 2035 Notes may increase by 0.75 percent. We will be unable to determine the actual increase, if any, of the interest rate on each of the November 2015 Notes and November 2035 Notes until after the closing of our proposed acquisition of Guidant. Any subsequent rating improvements will result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate. The interest rate on the date these senior notes were originally issued will be permanently reinstated if and when the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A or A3 or higher. In March 2005, we repaid $500 million of senior notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2004. The notes bore a semi annual coupon of 6.625 percent, were not redeemable prior to maturity and were not subject to any sinking fund requirements. In November 2004, we issued $250 million of senior notes due January 2011 (January 2011 Notes) and $250 million of senior notes due January 2017 (January 2017 Notes) under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in November 2004. The January 2011 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 4.25 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any 51 sinking fund requirements. The January 2017 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 5.125 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps indexed to six month LIBOR, which approximated 4.70 percent at December 31, 2005 and 2.78 percent at December 31, 2004, to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes. In June 2004, we issued $600 million of senior notes due June 2014 (June 2014 Notes) under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The June 2014 Notes bear a semi annual coupon of 5.45 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. We entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps indexed to six month LIBOR, which approximated 4.70 percent at December 31, 2005 and 2.78 percent at December 31, 2004, to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk for further discussion regarding the treatment of our interest rate swaps. The remainder of our outstanding borrowings, including capital lease arrangements, was immaterial at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Equity We repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million in 2005, 10 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $360 million in 2004, and 22 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $570 million in 2003. Since 1992, we have repurchased approximately 132 million shares of our common stock and we have approximately 24 million shares of our common stock held in treasury at year end. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including strategic alliances and acquisitions. During 2005, we received $94 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees. Guidant Acquisition At the effective time of the acquisition, each share of Guidant common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) $42.00 in cash and (ii) a number of shares of Boston Scientific common stock equal to $38.00, subject to the calculation of the exchange ratio. See Note O Subsequent Events to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details regarding the exchange ratio that will be used in determining the purchase price. Under the terms of the Abbott transaction agreement and at the closing of the Abbott transaction, Abbott has agreed to (1) pay an initial purchase price of $4.1 billion in cash plus potential future earn out payments for the Guidant vascular and endovascular businesses, (2) make a five year subordinated loan of $900 million to us at a 4.00 percent annual interest rate, and (3) purchase $1.4 billion in shares of Boston Scientific common stock. In connection with the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price, various banks have committed to providing up to $14 billion in financing, which includes a $7 billion 364 day interim credit facility, a $5 billion five year term loan facility and a $2 billion five year revolving credit facility. The interim credit facility, term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin between 0.30 percent (high A rating) and 0.85 percent (low BBB rating). The interest 52 margin will be based on the highest two out of three of our long term, senior unsecured, corporate credit ratings from Moodys Investor Service, Inc., Standard & Poors Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. Of the $14 billion available pursuant to the commitment letter, we expect to borrow approximately $7.1 billion to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition purchase price, which includes the $5 billion five year term loan facility and $2.1 billion in borrowings under the 364 day interim credit facility. We also expect to use the $900 million loan from Abbott, for a total of $8 billion in borrowings to finance the cash portion of the purchase price. In 2006, we anticipate filing a new public registration statement with the SEC under which we intend to issue senior notes in order to refinance any borrowings outstanding under the interim credit facility and to register shares that we will issue to Abbott. The new five year revolving credit facility will replace our existing $2 billion credit facilities. We also plan to use cash on hand and cash from the Abbott transaction to fund the cash portion of the Guidant purchase price. If the acquisition is completed, we intend to dedicate a significant portion of our future cash flow from operations to repay our outstanding debt obligations. We currently have investment grade credit ratings. During February 2006, our credit rating was downgraded. The rating agencies have also indicated that they will further downgrade our credit ratings when the Guidant acquisition is consummated. However, we expect our credit ratings to remain at investment grade levels following the acquisition. Our credit ratings affect our cost of borrowings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded below investment grade, our borrowing costs may increase and we may be subject to more stringent terms and conditions than those currently contained in our financing arrangements. In addition, our authorized common stock will be increased from 1,200,000,000 shares to 2,000,000,000 shares in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of Guidant. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments. See Notes D, F, H and O to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our business combinations, long term debt, lease arrangements, and subsequent events. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 1 Year or Less 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Debt principal* $ 156 $ 4 $ 2 $ 1,852 $ 2,014 Interest payments 100 200 200 846 1,346 Debt, including interest 256 204 202 2,698 3,360 Operating leases 47 56 9 2 114 Purchase obligations, 102 15 117 Minimum royalty obligations 3 6 4 8 21 Total $ 408 $ 281 $ 215 $ 2,708 $ 3,612 *Debt as reported in our consolidated balance sheets includes the mark to market effect of our interest rate swaps and is net of the unamortized investor discount associated with the issuance of senior notes in conjunction with our various public debt offerings. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. 53 On January 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $27 billion (net of proceeds from option exercises), which represents a combination of cash and stock worth $80 per share of Guidant common stock. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott has agreed to acquire Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular businesses. See Note O Subsequent Events to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details regarding the transaction. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. Certain of these payments are based on multiples of the acquired companys revenue during the earn out period and, consequently, we cannot currently determine the total payments. However, we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn out obligation. At December 31, 2005, the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately $4 billion, some of which may be payable in our common stock. The milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from 2006 through 2016. The estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately $10 billion. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. In addition, we are currently considering the exercise of our option to acquire EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc., a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. In conjunction with the acquisition of EndoTex, we would pay approximately $100 million in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately $35 million, plus future consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain performance related milestones. Further, many of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or require us to make certain payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments, we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above. Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A Significant Accounting Policies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates are considered critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider to be critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single use medical devices. Revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a 54 sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, which indicates that the sale is complete. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. Our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventories We state inventories at the lower of first in, first out cost or market. We base our provisions for excess or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. We record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales. Consignment inventory write downs are charged to selling, general and administrative expense and approximated $15 million in 2005, $10 million in 2004, and $8 million in 2003. Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in recent business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects, or for the acquisitions as a whole. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in process projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs 55 already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: in 2005, 18 percent to 27 percent; in 2004, 18 percent to 27 percent; and in 2003, 24 percent. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets We record intangible assets at historical cost. We amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization, including patents, licenses, developed technology and core technology, using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. We review these intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. We also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. We test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. Investments in Strategic Alliances As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in 66 strategic alliances totaling $594 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in 58 strategic alliances totaling $529 million. These assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities. We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment. As of December 31, 2005, we held investments totaling $85 million in three companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 21 percent to 28 percent. As of December 31, 2004, we held investments totaling $61 million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 25 percent to 30 percent. Factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include, but are not limited to: our level of representation on the board of directors; our participation in the investees policy making processes; transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business; interchange of managerial personnel; 56 the investees technological dependency on us; and our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholdings. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we initially record the investment at cost, and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements. Amounts recorded to adjust the carrying amounts of investments accounted for under the equity method were not material to our statements of operations in 2005, 2004 or 2003. When we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee, we follow the cost method of accounting. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee; or a significant doubt about an investees ability to continue as a going concern. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary, we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments, notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating $110 million at December 31, 2005 and $18 million at December 31, 2004. The liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future. The assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe these assets will be substantially recovered. See Note I Income Taxes to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We provide for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are $2,106 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,005 million at December 31, 2004. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 57 for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Legal Costs We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue costs of settlement, damages and, under certain conditions, costs of defense when a loss is deemed probable and such costs are estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for regulatory and litigation related costs that were probable and estimable was $20 million at December 31, 2005 and $99 million at December 31, 2004. See further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J Commitments and Contingencies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2005, a range of loss associated with these individual material legal proceedings can not be estimated due to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the proceedings. Product Liability Costs and Securities Litigation Claims We are substantially self insured with respect to general, product liability and securities litigation claims. In the normal course of business, product liability and securities litigation claims are asserted against us. We accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability and securities litigation claims based on historical experience, or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. We record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. Our accrual for product liability and securities litigation claims was $15 million at December 31, 2005 and $13 million at December 31, 2004. Product liability and securities litigation claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. The absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, based on product liability and securities litigation losses experienced in the past, our election to become substantially self insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations. Management believes that our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general, product liability and securities litigation losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Costs Associated with Exit Activities We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributed to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested and the payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We generally record such costs into expense over the future service period, if any. In addition, in conjunction with an employee termination, we may offer voluntary termination benefits to employees. These benefits are recorded when the employee accepts the termination benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Other costs associated with exit activities may include costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased and long lived asset impairments. During 2005, we recorded charges associated with exit activities of approximately $40 million. These charges included costs primarily attributable to employee terminations and outsourcing costs 58 within our human resources function and international divisions; and a $10 million write off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx Technology. The recognition of charges associated with exit activities requires our management to make judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity. Managements estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy, that no excess accruals are retained and that utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans. New Accounting Standard During 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In general, Statement No. 123(R) contains similar accounting concepts as those described in Statement No. 123. However, Statement No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Alternative phase in methods are allowed under Statement No. 123(R). We adopted Statement No. 123(R) on its effective date of January 1, 2006 using the "modified prospective method." Under this method, compensation cost is recognized (a) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006 and (b) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123 for all unvested awards that were granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006. We expect to apply the Black Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees, which will then be amortized on a straight line basis. As permitted by Statement No. 123, for periods prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share based payments to employees using Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for the granting of employee stock options, except as disclosed in Note L Stock Ownership Plans to our 2005 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement No. 123(R)s fair value method will negatively impact our statements of operations. The impact of adoption of Statement No. 123(R) cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future, expected volatilities and expected useful lives, among other factors, present at the grant date. However, had Statement No. 123(R) been effective in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in Note A Significant Accounting Policies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Statement No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of Statement No. 123(R). While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $28 million in 2005, $185 million in 2004 and $154 million in 2003. Further, most of our stock option awards provide for immediate vesting upon retirement, death or disability of the participant. We have traditionally accounted for the pro forma compensation expense related to stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals using the stated vesting period of the grant. This approach results in recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participants actual retirement. Statement No. 123(R) clarified the accounting for 59 stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals, which explicitly provides that the vesting period for a grant made to a retirement eligible employee is considered non substantive and should be ignored when determining the period over which the award should be expensed. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will be required to expense stock based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility or immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant. If we had historically accounted for stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals under these requirements, the pro forma expense disclosed in Note A would not have been materially impacted for the periods presented. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ JAMES R. TOBIN President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ LAWRENCE C. BEST Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 60  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2006 61   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $3,593 million at December 31, 2005 and $4,171 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in the outstanding amount of our currency derivative instruments is primarily due to the maturity of hedge contracts. We recorded $176 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2005 as compared to $70 million of other assets and $129 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2004. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $129 million at December 31, 2005 and by $163 million at December 31, 2004. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $157 million at December 31, 2005 and $190 million at December 31, 2004. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or cash flow. Our earnings and cash flow are exposed to interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated debt partially offset by interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated cash investments. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting either floating rate debt into fixed rate debt or fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. We had interest rate swaps outstanding in the notional amount of $1,100 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,600 million at December 31, 2004. Our interest rate swaps hedge against potential changes in the fair value of certain of our senior notes and are designated as fair value hedges. The decrease in the notional amount of our interest rate swaps is due to the maturing of hedge contracts related to our $500 million 6.625 percent senior notes, which we repaid upon maturity during March 2005. To recognize the fair value of these interest rate swaps, we recorded $21 million of other assets and $7 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2005 as compared to $32 million of other assets and $1 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2004. A one percentage point increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $74 million at December 31, 2005 as compared to $84 million at December 31, 2004. A one percentage point decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $80 million at December 31, 2005 as compared to $92 million at December 31, 2004. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability. 62
