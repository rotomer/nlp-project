ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our quality policy, applicable to all employees, is I improve the quality of patient care and all things Boston Scientific. Our managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an overview of the Guidant acquisition, which represents a transforming event for Boston Scientific. It then provides an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2006 and identifies some key trends that impacted operating results during the year. We supplement this summary with an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects. Next is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2006 as compared to 2005 and our operating results for 2005 as compared to 2004. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical accounting policies. Guidant Acquisition and Abbott Transaction On April 21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $28.4 billion, which represented a combination of cash, common stock and fully vested stock options. The purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately $21.7 billion. In conjunction with the acquisition, we acquired approximately $6.7 billion of cash, including $4.1 billion in connection with Guidants prior sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more than $9 billion global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition has established us as one of the worlds largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics. Guidant makes a variety of implantable devices that can monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including tachycardia, heart failure and bradycardia. These devices include implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems (ICDs) and pacemaker systems. In addition, Guidant also makes cardiac surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation, endoscopic vessel harvesting and clampless beating heart bypass surgery. Prior to our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific. This agreement gives us access to a second drug eluting stent program, which will complement our existing TAXUS stent system program. See Note D Business Combinations to our 36 [Table of Contents] 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details on the transaction. We consolidated Guidants operating results with those of Boston Scientific beginning on the date of the acquisition, April 21, 2006. Since we have not restated our results retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Guidant, fluctuations in our operating results for 2006 are due primarily to the acquisition of Guidant. However, we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in Note D Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K to give effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of 2006 and 2005. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2006 increased to $7.821 billion from $6.283 billion in 2005. Our reported net loss for 2006 was $3.577 billion, or $2.81 per diluted share, on approximately 1.274 billion weighted average shares outstanding as compared to net income of $628 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, on approximately 838 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2005. Our reported results included net after tax charges primarily related to the acquisition of Guidant of $4.537 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share, in 2006 as compared to net after tax charges of $894 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in 2005.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $1.845 billion in 2006 as compared to $903 million in 2005. The growth in net sales resulted largely from our acquisition of Guidant, which accounted for sales of $1.503 billion. The geographic mix of Guidant sales included $1.025 billion of U.S. and $478 million of international sales. The business mix of Guidant sales consisted of $1.371 billion of CRM net sales and $132 million of Cardiac Surgery net sales. Our CRM net sales were comprised of $988 million of ICDs and $383 million of pacemaker systems. On a pro forma basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026 billion in 2006 as compared to $2.28 billion in 2005. The decline, on a pro forma basis, was a result of lower average market shares for the Guidant devices in 2006 relative to 2005. We believe the lower market share, as well as reduced market growth rates, was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry. However, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from our CRM business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing and will return to growth. We remain focused on our share recovery. The increase in our sales as a result of the acquisition of Guidant was partially offset by a decrease in TAXUS stent system sales to $2.358 billion in 2006 from $2.556 billion in 2005. The geographic mix of TAXUS stent system sales in 2006 included $1.561 billion of U.S. and $797 million of international sales. In 2005, we had $1.763 billion of U.S. and $793 million of international sales. The decline in TAXUS sales during 2006 was attributable to a decrease in the U.S. market size due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents and a decline in 1 The 2006 net after tax charges consisted of: $4.477 billion in expenses resulting from purchase accounting associated primarily with purchased research and development obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition and the step up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold; $143 million in acquisition related costs, including the fair value adjustment related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, a CRM technology offering charge and other business integration costs; a $31 million credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) program that we obtained as part of the TriVascular, Inc. acquisition; $81 million in write downs attributable to our investment portfolio; and a $133 million one time tax benefit for the reversal of tax accruals previously established for offshore unremitted earnings. The 2005 net after tax charges consisted of a $598 million litigation settlement with Medinol Ltd. and $267 million in purchased research and development attributable primarily to our 2005 acquisitions. 37 [Table of Contents] average market shares in 2006 relative to 2005. Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. Exiting 2005, the percentage of drug eluting stents used in U.S. interventional procedures were in the high 80 percent range, as compared to U.S. drug eluting stent market penetration rates in the low 70 percent range exiting 2006. Our U.S. drug eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of 2005, but has been stable during 2006 and we have maintained our market leadership position. We expect to launch our TAXUS Express2 stent system in the Japan market, which we believe exceeds $500 million, in the second half of 2007 and our TAXUS Libert stent system in the U.S., subject to regulatory approvals. During 2006, our worldwide Endosurgery group sales increased to $1.346 billion from $1.228 billion in 2005, an increase of 10 percent. Further, our Neuromodulation division, formed following the June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, generated $234 million in net sales during 2006 as compared to $148 million in 2005, an increase of 58 percent. Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 77.9 percent in 2005 to 71.8 percent in 2006 largely as a result of certain one time purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Guidant acquisition. In addition, our gross profit declined by approximately 2.0 percentage points due to period expenses, including costs associated with Project Horizon, a corporate wide cross functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems. Our gross profit also declined by 0.8 percentage points due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents in the U.S. Our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in 2006 from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. In the second half of 2006, we maintained existing spending levels given our expectation that the CRM market and the drug eluting stent market will recover over time and this infrastructure will be necessary to support future growth. In addition, we announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources, including those in the research and development and sales and marketing functions; to increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness; and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients. This plan resulted in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees during the first quarter of 2007. We intend to reinvest the bulk of the savings from the plan back into the CRM business to create a strong, competitive pipeline that will help grow revenue that, combined with expense controls, should lead to increased profitability. The reinvestment will include additional hiring within the research and development function where there were shortages of desired skills. We continue to be focused on examining our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures and reallocate resources to support growth initiatives. At December 31, 2006, we had total outstanding debt of $8.902 billion, related primarily to the Guidant acquisition, cash of $1.668 billion and working capital of $2.271 billion. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2006. We expect to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years; our first upcoming debt maturity is in April 2008 for $650 million. 38 [Table of Contents] FDA Warning Letters On January 26, 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval (PMA) applications for class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies have been corrected. During 2005, in order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls, we launched Project Horizon, a corporate wide cross functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems. As part of Project Horizon, we have made modifications to our process validation and complaint management systems. Project Horizon has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as well as incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. In 2006, our Board of Directors created a Compliance and Quality Committee to monitor our compliance and quality initiatives. We believe we have identified solutions to the quality issues cited by the FDA, and we continue to make progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. We communicate frequently and meet regularly with the FDA to apprise them of our progress. The FDA has communicated the need for us to complete substantially all remediation efforts before they will reinspect our facilities. We have engaged a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate wide compliance prior to reinspection by the FDA. We believe we will be ready for the third party audit in the second quarter of 2007. On December 23, 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This FDA warning letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on September 1, 2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a follow up letter from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this follow up letter, until we have corrected the identified deficiencies, the FDA may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve PMA applications for class III devices to which the deficiencies described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further inspection of the CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and February 9, 2006 and made one additional inspectional observation. The FDA has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. While we believe this reinspection went well, we may be required to take additional actions in order to comply with any FDA observations that we may receive. Outlook Guidant Acquisition On April 21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more than $9 billion global CRM business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition has established us as one of the worlds largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics. The integration of Guidants operations and product lines with Boston Scientifics is complex and time consuming, and the separation of the Guidant businesses required by the Abbott transaction adds complexity to the transition process. We have entered transition services agreements with Abbott, under which Abbott and Boston Scientific provide or make available to each other certain services, rights, properties and assets for a temporary period. Many of these transition services agreements expire during 2007. The failure to integrate Boston Scientific and Guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process effectively, including the retention of key Guidant personnel and the 39 [Table of Contents] timely execution of activities under the transition services agreement, may reduce the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition. During 2007, we will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate certain operations of Guidant. In January 2007, we announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources, including those in research and development as well as sales and marketing functions, to increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness, and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients. This plan resulted in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees during the first quarter of 2007. There can be no assurances that we will realize efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses sufficient to offset incremental transaction, acquisition related, integration and restructuring costs over time. Net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses were $1.503 billion for 2006, including $1.371 billion of CRM sales and $132 million of Cardiac Surgery sales. On a pro forma basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026 billion in 2006 as compared to $2.28 billion in 2005. The decline, on a pro forma basis, was a result of lower average market shares for the Guidant devices in 2006 relative to 2005. We believe the lower market share, as well as reduced market growth rates, was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry. These field actions included Guidants decision announced on June 24, 2005 to stop selling Guidants leading defibrillator systems temporarily, which were returned to the market beginning on August 2, 2005. In addition, on June 26, 2006, we announced that we were retrieving a specific subset of pacemakers, cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers and ICDs due to a suppliers low voltage capacitor not performing consistently. We believe that these field actions contributed to our CRM division having a lower market share for ICDs and pacemaker systems for 2006 as compared to 2005. The worldwide CRM market growth rates, including the U.S. defibrillator market, declined during the first three quarters of 2006; these growth levels are below those experienced in recent years. The U.S. defibrillator market represents approximately half of the worldwide CRM market. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from our CRM business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing and will return to growth. We expect that growth rates in the worldwide CRM market, and the U.S. ICD market, will recover over several years. However, there can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical growth rates or that we will be able to regain CRM market share or increase net sales in a timely manner, if at all. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and our position within this market include: future product recalls or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; our ability to resolve the issues identified in the CRM warning letter to the satisfaction of the FDA; variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products; our ability to retain our sales force and other key personnel; our ability to reestablish the trust and confidence of the implanting community, the referring community and prospective patients in our technology; delayed or limited regulatory approvals; 40 [Table of Contents] our ability to launch next generation products and technology features in a timely manner, if at all; international economic and regulatory conditions; new competitive launches; unfavorable reimbursement policies; declines in average selling prices; the overall number of procedures performed; and the outcome of legal proceedings related to our CRM business. We remain focused on our market share recovery and intend to accelerate recovery by regaining the trust and confidence of the implanting community, the referring community and prospective patients; continuing to improve our quality systems; investing in new technologies and clinical trials; retaining our sales force and other key personnel; continuing research and development productivity; and improving physician and patient communication. However, if these efforts are not successful, and the CRM market does not recover according to our expectations, or we are unable to regain market share and net sales on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Coronary Stent Business Coronary stent revenue represented approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006, as compared to 43 percent in 2005, primarily as a result of the Guidant acquisition. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $6 billion in 2006, and estimate that drug eluting stents represented approximately 90 percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2006. The U.S. drug eluting stent market for 2006 approximated $3 billion. Our U.S. TAXUS sales declined to $1.561 billion for 2006 as compared to $1.763 billion for 2005. Recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents contributed to a decline in the U.S. stent market size. In addition to the decline in U.S. drug eluting stent market penetration, device utilization per procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention volume has decreased likely due to market conservatism. We believe this conservatism is a temporary circumstance that, if alleviated, may lead to an increase in future procedural volume and usage of drug eluting stents. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the FDA held a special advisory panel meeting to discuss drug eluting stents. Members of the panel concluded that drug eluting stents remain safe and effective when used as indicated, and that the benefits outweigh the risks. We believe that percutaneous coronary interventions, device utilization per procedure and drug eluting stent penetration rates will increase in the future, and result in a market recovery; however, there can be no assurance that this will happen or that the market will recover to previous levels. We expect that our U.S. drug eluting stent sales in 2007 may be below those experienced in 2006. During 2006, our international TAXUS stent system net sales remained consistent with 2005. Drug eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of 2006 and exiting 2006, the effect of which offset declines in our market share associated with several competitive launches of new drug eluting stent products in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. We expect competitive launches in these geographies to continue to put pressure on our market share and average selling prices in 2007. In addition, we expect that drug eluting stent penetration rates will remain relatively consistent in our Europe and Inter Continental markets during 2007 due primarily to concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis. Subject to regulatory 41 [Table of Contents] approval, we expect to launch our TAXUS Express 2 stent system in Japan during the second half of 2007, where we estimate a drug eluting stent market size exceeding $500 million. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the markets perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. However, we believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons, including: the results of our TAXUS clinical trials; the performance benefits of our current technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and our second drug eluting stent platform obtained as a result of our Guidant acquisition. However, a material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: continued concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis; the entry of additional competitors in international markets and the U.S.; continued physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug eluting stents; our ability to resolve the issues identified in the current legacy Boston Scientific corporate warning letter to the satisfaction of the FDA; declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems; variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitors products; delayed or limited regulatory approvals; the overall number of procedures performed; unfavorable reimbursement policies; 42 [Table of Contents] intellectual property litigation; the average number of stents used per procedure; our ability to maintain and expand indications for use; our ability to launch next generation products and technology features; the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology; international economic and regulatory conditions; and the level of supply of our drug eluting stent systems and competitive stent systems. The TAXUS drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the U.S. market. Our share of the drug eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, may be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug eluting stent market, which could occur as early as the second half of 2007 in the U.S. Prior to our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific, including the XIENCE V everolimus eluting coronary stent system. In October of 2006, we received CE mark approval to begin marketing the PROMUS stent system, which is a private labeled XIENCE V drug eluting coronary stent system supplied to us by Abbott. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we initiated a limited launch of the PROMUS stent system in certain European countries. We expect to launch the PROMUS stent system in certain Inter Continental countries in the second quarter of 2007 and in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the profit margin of a PROMUS stent system will be significantly lower than our TAXUS drug eluting stent. Therefore, the mix of PROMUS stent system revenue relative to our total drug eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our overall profitability as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we will incur incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize products utilizing the Guidant drug eluting stent system technology and to support the launch of our internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent system in the future, which we expect will have profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS stent system. Regulatory Compliance In January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities. During 2005, in order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls, we launched Project Horizon, which has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as well as incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. See the FDA Warning Letters section above for further information regarding the FDA warning letters. There can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. Our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner may further delay product launch schedules, including the U.S. launch of our TAXUS Libert stent, which may weaken our competitive position in the markets in which we participate. If our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including, but not limited to, seizing our product inventory, 43 [Table of Contents] obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products, issuing a consent decree or assessing civil monetary penalties. Intellectual Property Litigation There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our existing competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market. See Note J Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of these legal proceedings. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a result of our agreement with Abbott, we now have access to a second drug eluting stent program, which will complement our existing TAXUS stent system program. We expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug eluting stent program, along with our internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent program, to continue to sustain our worldwide drug eluting stent market leadership position. During 2007, we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and development expenses as a result of our dual drug eluting stent program. We successfully launched our next generation drug eluting stent product, the TAXUS Libert stent system, during 2005 in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. We expect to launch our TAXUS Libert stent system in the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our CRM technologies, including our LATITUDE Patient Management System, which is technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients remain in their homes, and the Frontier CRM technology, our next generation pulse generator platform. In October 2006, the FDA approved expansion of our LATITUDE System to be used for remote monitoring in certain existing ICDs and cardiac resynchronization defibrillators. We also expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug eluting stent and CRM technologies. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth. Our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic growth initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek 44 [Table of Contents] market opportunities and growth through selective strategic alliances and acquisitions. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. Even though we believe that the drug eluting stent market and CRM market will recover above existing levels, there can be no assurance to the timing or extent of this recovery. In 2007, we will continue to reprioritize our internal research and development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio primarily based on expectations of future market growth. This reprioritization may result in our decision to sell, discontinue, write down, or otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects, operations, investments or assets. Any proceeds from sales, or any increases in operating cash flows, resulting from such management actions may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested in other research and development projects or other operational initiatives. Reimbursement and Funding Our products are purchased by hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers who are reimbursed by third party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on assessment criteria as determined by the third party payor. Reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and often conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. There is no way of predicting the outcome of reimbursement decisions, or their impact on our operating results. Third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. International Markets International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our sales growth and profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we are required to receive or renew regulatory approvals and obtain exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our products in certain international jurisdictions. These approvals and certificates could be impacted by the FDA warning letters we have received. If these approvals and certificates are not renewed or obtained on a timely basis, our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 45 [Table of Contents] Results of Operations Net Sales The following table provides our net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As Reported Currency Basis Constant Currency Basis As Reported Currency Basis Constant Currency Basis United States $ 4,840 $ 3,852 $ 3,502 26 % 26 % 10 % 10 % Europe 1,574 1,161 994 36 % 34 % 17 % 17 % Japan 594 579 613 3 % 8 % (6 %) (4 %) Inter Continental 813 691 515 18 % 16 % 34 % 28 % International 2,981 2,431 2,122 23 % 22 % 15 % 13 % Worldwide $ 7,821 $ 6,283 $ 5,624 24 % 24 % 12 % 11 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported basis: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 Interventional Cardiology $ 3,612 $ 3,783 $ 3,451 (5 %) 10 % Peripheral Interventions/ Vascular Surgery 666 715 656 (7 %) 9 % Electrophysiology 134 132 130 2 % 2 % Neurovascular 326 277 253 18 % 9 % Cardiac Surgery 132 N/A N/A N/A N/A Cardiac Rhythm Management 1,371 N/A N/A N/A N/A Cardiovascular 6,241 4,907 4,490 27 % 9 % Oncology 221 207 186 7 % 11 % Endoscopy 754 697 641 8 % 9 % Urology 371 324 261 15 % 24 % Endosurgery 1,346 1,228 1,088 10 % 13 % Neuromodulation 234 148 46 58 % 222 % Worldwide $ 7,821 $ 6,283 $ 5,624 24 % 12 % We manage our international operating regions and divisions on a constant currency basis, while market risk from currency exchange rate changes is managed at the corporate level. The relative change on a constant currency basis by division approximated the change on an as reported basis. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant currency exchange rates. 46 [Table of Contents] U.S. Net Sales In 2006, our U.S. net sales increased by $988 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase is related primarily to the inclusion of $1.025 billion of U.S. net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. In addition, we experienced increases in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. Offsetting this increase were declines in our U.S. net sales of TAXUS coronary stent systems to $1.561 billion for 2006 as compared to $1.763 billion for 2005 and sales decreases of approximately $70 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the expiration during the first quarter of 2006 of our agreement to distribute certain third party guidewire and sheath products. The decline in TAXUS sales was due principally to a decrease in the U.S. drug eluting stent market size and a decline in average TAXUS market share in 2006 relative to 2005. The drug eluting stent market decline was due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents, which resulted in conservative usage by physicians. The overall size of the U.S. drug eluting stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary interventional procedures performed; the number of devices used per procedure; the drug eluting stent penetration rate or mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents across procedures; and average drug eluting stent selling prices. The primary reason for the decline in the U.S. drug eluting stent market size was lower penetration rates in 2006 relative to 2005. Exiting 2005, the percentage of drug eluting stents used in U.S. interventional procedures were in the high 80 percent range, as compared to U.S. drug eluting stent market penetration rates in the low 70 percent range exiting 2006. The drug eluting stent market also declined due to decreases in the number of devices used per procedure and slight reductions in average selling prices. Our drug eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of 2005, but has been stable during 2006. See the Outlook section for a more detailed discussion of the drug eluting stent market and our position within that market. In 2005, our U.S. net sales increased by $350 million, or 10 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase resulted largely from a full year of TAXUS stent system sales, which we launched in March 2004. U.S. TAXUS stent system sales for 2005 were $1.763 billion as compared to $1.57 billion for 2004, offset by a reduction in market share compared to the prior year. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. International Net Sales In 2006, our international net sales increased by $550 million, or 23 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase related primarily to the inclusion of $478 million of international net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $35 million in net sales from our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our Neurovascular division. TAXUS stent system sales in our Europe and Inter Continental markets were $797 million in 2006 as compared to $793 million in 2005. TAXUS stent system sales were favorably impacted by drug eluting stent penetration rates in these markets. The drug eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of 2006 and exiting 2006. Market share declines associated with several competitors having launched new drug eluting stent products in these markets offset the favorable impact of increased penetration rates. In 2006, our legacy Boston Scientific net sales in Japan, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, were relatively consistent with the prior year. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and government mandated pricing reductions for other products, we do not expect significant revenue growth in our legacy Japan business until we launch our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan, 47 [Table of Contents] which we expect to occur during the second half of 2007. Japan net sales for 2006 included $62 million from CRM and Cardiac Surgery products. In 2005, our international net sales increased by $309 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $220 million, or 38 percent, in our Europe and Inter Continental markets. This increase in TAXUS stent system sales in these markets was primarily the result of increased market penetration rates, as well as the successful launch of our TAXUS Libert stent system during 2005. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $57 million in incremental sales from our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our Neuromodulation division. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Gross profit 5,614 71.8 4,897 77.9 4,332 77.0 In 2006, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 6.1 percentage points as compared to 2005. Our gross profit for 2006 decreased as a percentage of net sales by 3.8 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to costs associated with Guidant, including $267 million in step up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold during the period and a $31 million charge associated with making our LATITUDE Patient Management System available to many of our existing CRM patients without additional charge. In connection with the accounting for the Guidant acquisition, we wrote up inventory acquired from manufacturing cost to fair value. As of December 31, 2006, we had no inventory step up value remaining in inventory. In addition, our gross profit for 2006 decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately 2.0 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to period expenses, including costs associated with Project Horizon and certain inventory charges. Shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents in the U.S., decreased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.8 percentage points. These decreases were offset by a 0.8 percentage point increase due to the favorable change in currency exchange rates on our gross profit. In 2005, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.9 percentage points as compared to 2004. Our 2004 gross profit decreased by approximately 1.0 percentage points due to $57 million in inventory write downs, including a $43 million write down attributable to recalls of certain of our coronary stent systems and a $14 million write down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf life dating. In addition, shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily TAXUS stents, increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Our gross profit for 2005 was reduced as a percentage of net sales by 0.9 percentage points related to period expenses, including manufacturing start up costs primarily associated with our TAXUS Libert stent system and increased investment in quality initiatives. The remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily related to the favorable change in currency exchange rates. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in 2006 from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. The significant increase in 48 [Table of Contents] each of our operating expense categories is primarily a result of Guidant operating expenses. The following table provides a summary of our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation related charges: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,675 34.2 1,814 28.9 1,742 31.0 Research and development expenses 1,008 12.9 680 10.8 569 10.1 Royalty expense 231 3.0 227 3.6 195 3.5 Amortization expense 530 6.8 152 2.4 112 2.0 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2006, our SG&A expenses increased by $861 million, or 47 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 34.2 percent in 2006 from 28.9 percent for the same period in the prior year. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to: $670 million in expenditures associated with Guidant; $65 million of acquisition related costs associated primarily with certain Guidant integration and retention programs; increases of $63 million due primarily to increased headcount attributable to the expansion of our sales force within our international regions and Neuromodulation division; and $55 million in incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. See the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note L Stock Ownership Plans for a more detailed discussion of Statement No. 123(R). SG&A expenses for 2005 included $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization initiatives and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. In 2005, our SG&A expenses increased by $72 million, or four percent, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily related to: approximately $100 million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our Interventional Cardiology business unit and Endosurgery group and costs related to market development initiatives; $75 million in incremental operating expenses associated with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics; $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization initiatives; $19 million in stock based compensation expense associated primarily with the issuance of deferred stock units in 2005; and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. Certain charges incurred in 2004 partially offset these increases, including a $110 million enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, and a $90 million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 28.9 percent in 2005 from 31.0 percent in 2004 primarily due to the increase in our net sales in 2005. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses Our investment in R&D reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2006, our R&D expenses increased by $328 million, or 48 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased to 12.9 percent in 2006 from 10.8 percent in 2005. The increase primarily related to: the inclusion of $270 million in expenditures associated with Guidant; approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $24 million of stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R); and $13 million of acquisition related costs associated with certain Guidant 49 [Table of Contents] integration and retention programs. See the Purchased Research and Development section for further discussion regarding the cancellation of our TriVascular AAA stent graft program. In 2005, our R&D expenses increased by $111 million, or 20 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 10.8 percent in 2005 from 10.1 percent in 2004. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $60 million in incremental R&D expense attributable to our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics and TriVascular. In addition, we increased spending on internal R&D projects within our Endosurgery group by $25 million. Royalty Expense In 2006, our royalty expense increased by $4 million, or 2 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase was due to $25 million of royalty expense associated with the CRM and Cardiac Surgery products that we acquired as part of the Guidant acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease in royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system by $20 million to $153 million for 2006 as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense decreased to 3.0 percent in 2006 from 3.6 percent in 2005. This decrease was primarily a result of the inclusion of net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery products, which on average have a lower royalty cost relative to legacy Boston Scientific net sales. In 2005, our royalty expense increased by $32 million, or 16 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.6 percent in 2005 from 3.5 percent in 2004. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $27 million to $174 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. Amortization Expense In 2006, our amortization expense increased by $378 million, or 249 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 6.8 percent in 2006 from 2.4 percent in 2005. The increase in our amortization expense related primarily to: $334 million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition; $23 million for the write off of intangible assets due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $21 million for the write off of the intangible assets associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005 acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation; and $12 million for the write off of the intangible assets associated with our Real time Position Management System (RPM) technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as part of our acquisition of Cardiac Pathways Corporation. The write off of the RPM intangible assets resulted from our decision to cease investment in the technology. The write off of the Rubicon developed technology resulted from our decision to redesign the first generation of the technology and concentrate resources on the development and commercialization of the next generation product. We do not expect these program cancellations and related write offs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. Amortization expense for 2005 included a $10 million write off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx Liquid Polymer Technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as a part of our acquisition of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc.. The write off resulted from our decision during 2005 to cease selling the Enteryx product. In 2005, our amortization expense increased by $40 million, or 36 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.4 percent in 2005 from 2.0 percent in 2004. The increase in our amortization expense was due primarily to $25 million in incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in conjunction with our 2004 and 2005 50 [Table of Contents] acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics. In addition, amortization expense included a $10 million write off of intangible assets related to Enteryx. Interest Expense Our interest expense increased to $435 million in 2006 as compared to $90 million in 2005. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels used to finance the Guidant acquisition, as well as an increase in our weighted average borrowing cost. Our average debt levels for 2006 increased to approximately $7.2 billion as compared to approximately $2.4 billion for 2005. Our weighted average borrowing cost for 2006 increased to 6.1 percent from 3.8 percent for 2005. At December 31, 2006, $5.886 billion, or 81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding net debt is at fixed interest rates. Our interest expense increased to $90 million in 2005 from $64 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to an increase in average market interest rates on our borrowings. Fair Value Adjustment During 2006, we recorded net expense of $95 million to reflect the change in fair value related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, which is discussed in further detail at Note D Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. This sharing of proceeds feature is being marked to market through earnings based upon changes in our stock price, among other factors. Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $56 million in 2006, income of $13 million in 2005 and expense of $16 million in 2004. Our other, net included investment write downs of $121 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and $58 million in 2004, in each case attributable to an other than temporary decline in fair value of certain strategic alliances. These write downs were partially offset by realized gains on investments of $9 million in 2006, $4 million in 2005 and $36 million in 2004. Our write downs during 2006 included charges of $34 million associated with investment write downs due primarily to the termination of a gene therapy trial being conducted by one of our portfolio companies. In addition, we recorded $27 million of investment write downs related to one of our vascular sealing portfolio companies due to continued delays in its technology development and the resulting deterioration in its financial condition. The remaining investment write downs were not individually significant. We do not expect these write downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $67 million in 2006, $36 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2004. Our interest income increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to increases in our cash and cash equivalents balances and increases in average market interest rates. Our interest income in 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due to increases in average market interest rates. 51 [Table of Contents] Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 Reported tax rate 1.2% 29.5% 28.9% (28.3) 0.6 Impact of certain charges (20.2%) 5.5% 4.9% (25.7) 0.6 In 2006, the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2005 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2006 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges include: purchased research and development; asset write downs; reversal of taxes associated with unremitted earnings; and tax gain on the sale of intangible assets. As of December 31, 2005, we had recorded a $133 million deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we had anticipated repatriating in the foreseeable future. During 2006, we made a significant acquisition that, when combined with certain changes in business conditions subsequent to the acquisition, resulted in a reevaluation of this liability. We have determined that we will not repatriate these earnings in the foreseeable future and, instead, we will indefinitely reinvest these earnings in foreign operations to repay debt obligations associated with the acquisition. As a result, we reversed the deferred tax liability and reduced income tax expense by $133 million in 2006. We currently estimate that our 2007 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 21 percent due primarily to our intention to reinvest offshore substantially all of our offshore earnings. However, acquisitions or dispositions in 2007 and geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2005, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2004 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2005 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges include: certain litigation related charges; purchased research and development; asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; costs related to certain retirement benefits; and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Litigation Related Charges In 2005, we recorded a $780 million pre tax charge associated with the Medinol litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in Medinol. In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which we paid in 2005. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Purchased Research and Development During 2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development. This amount included a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with the purchased research and development obtained 52 [Table of Contents] in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition; a credit of approximately $67 million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of approximately $17 million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment in EndoTex Interventional Systems. The $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the Guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired CRM related products and approximately $540 million for drug eluting stent technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes approximately $369 million that represents the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses it acquired from Guidant. We recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals, and the asset has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The most significant purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant include the Frontier CRM technology and rights to the everolimus eluting stent technology that we share with Abbott. The Frontier CRM technology represents Guidants next generation pulse generator platform that will incorporate new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing know how and institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this platform across all CRM product lines to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart. We expect to launch various Frontier based products commercially in the U.S. over the next 36 months, subject to regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the total costs to complete the Frontier CRM technology is between $150 million and $200 million. We expect material cash inflows from Frontier based products to commence in 2008. The $540 million attributable to the everolimus eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to Guidants everolimus based drug eluting stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched PROMUS, our first generation everolimus based stent, supplied by Abbott, in limited quantities in Europe. We expect to launch a first generation everolimus eluting stent, supplied by Abbott, in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval. We expect to launch an internally manufactured next generation everolimus based stent in Europe in 2010 and in the U.S. in 2011. We expect that material net cash inflows (net of operating costs, including research and development costs to complete) from our internally manufactured everolimus based drug eluting stent will commence in 2010 or 2011, following its approval in Europe and in the U.S. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the cost to complete the next generation everolimus eluting stent technology project is between $200 million and $250 million. The in process projects acquired in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition are generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date. In 2005, we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005 purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to our acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST); $45 million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon; and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular Systems, Inc. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our strategic partners, is currently developing. This technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimers disease and other neurological conditions. The most significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included TriVasculars AAA stent graft and ASTs Petal bifurcation stent, which collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 53 [Table of Contents] purchased research and development. During the second quarter of 2006, management cancelled the TriVascular AAA stent graft program. The program cancellation was due principally to forecasted increases in time and costs to complete the development of the stent graft and to receive regulatory approval. We do not expect the program cancellation and related write downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. The cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program resulted in the shutdown of our facility in Santa Rosa, California and the displacement of approximately 300 employees. During 2006, we recorded a charge to research and development expenses of approximately $20 million associated primarily with write downs of fixed assets and a charge to research and development expenses of approximately $10 million associated with severance and related costs incurred in connection with the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge related to the remaining TriVascular intangible assets and reversed our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting. The effect of the write off of these assets and liabilities was a $23 million charge to amortization expense and a $67 million credit to purchased research and development during the second quarter of 2006. We completed substantially the shutdown activities during the third quarter of 2006. ASTs Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel where a single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between $100 million and $125 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the Petal bifurcation stent to begin in 2011, which is when we expect the stent to be commercially available in the U.S. in a drug eluting configuration. The AST Petal bifurcation stent in process project is generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date. In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our acquisitions of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our acquisition of Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. The most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics bion microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in process projects value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the bion microstimulator for migraine headaches to be approximately $35 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the bion microstimulator to commence in 2011, following its approval in the U.S., which we expect to occur in 2010. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the drug delivery pump to be between $50 million and $60 million. We continue to assess the pace and risk of development of the drug delivery pump, as well as general market opportunities for the pump, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval or lower potential market value. We currently expect material net cash inflows from the drug delivery pump to commence in 2012, following its approval in the U.S., which we expect to occur in 2011 or 2012. The estimated timing and costs to complete the bion microstimulator and the drug delivery pump have increased relative to what we estimated as of the acquisition date; however, we do not believe these increases will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables provide a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance: 54 [Table of Contents] (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,668 $ 689 $ 1,296 Short term marketable securities 159 344 Cash provided by operating activities 1,845 903 1,804 Cash used for investing activities 9,312 551 1,622 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 8,439 (954 ) 439 EBITDA2 (2,273 ) 1,278 1,904 (in millions) 2006 2005 Short term debt $ 7 $ 156 Long term debt 8,895 1,864 Gross debt 8,902 2,020 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,668 848 Net debt $ 7,234 $ 1,172 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre tax charges of $4.715 billion in 2006, $1.112 billion in 2005 and $340 million in 2004; see the Executive Summary section for a description of these charges. Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. The increase in cash generated by our operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable primarily to significant one time payments made during 2005, consisting of: an approximate $75 million settlement payment made to the Department of Justice; a one time $110 million 401(k) contribution; a cash settlement with Medinol of $750 million; and tax payments, including those associated with the American Jobs Creation Act. Cash paid for income taxes and interest was $423 million in 2006 and $437 million in 2005. We expect to make approximately $400 million in tax payments during the first quarter of 2007 associated primarily with the gain on the sale of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott. 2 The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net (loss) income: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 EBITDA $ (2,273 ) $ 1,278 $ 1,904 Interest income 67 36 20 Interest expense (435 ) (90 ) (64 ) Income taxes (42 ) (263 ) (432 ) Stock based compensation expense (113 ) (19 ) (91 ) Depreciation and amortization (781 ) (314 ) (275 ) Net (loss) income $ (3,577 ) $ 628 $ 1,062 55 [Table of Contents] Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $341 million in 2006 and 2005. Capital expenditures in 2006 included $107 million associated with our CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. Legacy Boston Scientific capital expenditures declined in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significant capital expenditures incurred in the prior year to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $450 million during 2007, which includes a full year of capital expenditures for our CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions; and capital expenditures to further upgrade our quality systems, to enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug eluting stent platform, to facilitate the integration of Guidant and to support continuous growth in our business units, including our Neuromodulation division. Our investing activities during 2006 included: $15.4 billion of cash payments for our acquisition of Guidant, including approximately $100 million associated with the buyout of options of certain former Guidant vascular intervention and endovascular solutions employees in connection with the sale of these businesses to Abbott, and approximately $800 million of direct acquisition costs; $6.7 billion of cash acquired from Guidant, including proceeds of $4.1 billion from Guidants sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott; $397 million in contingent payments associated primarily with Advanced Bionics, CryoVascular and Smart Therapeutics, Inc.; and $65 million of net payments for strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded entities. In January 2007, we acquired EndoTex, a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. In conjunction with the acquisition of EndoTex, we paid approximately $100 million, which included approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million and cash of $10 million, in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately $40 million, plus future consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain performance related milestones. We do not expect significant purchased research and development charges associated with this acquisition because EndoTex obtained FDA approval of its carotid stent system prior to acquisition. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. We had outstanding borrowings of $8.902 billion at December 31, 2006 at a weighted average interest rate of 6.03 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $2.02 billion at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 percent. During 2006, we received net proceeds from borrowings of $6.888 billion, which we used primarily to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition. There were no amounts outstanding against our available credit lines of $2.35 billion at December 31, 2006. See Note F Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for specific details regarding our 2006 and 2005 debt transactions. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our long term debt as of December 31, 2006, is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 650 $ 650 $ 1,700 $ 2,000 $ 5,000 Abbott loan 900 900 Senior notes 850 $ 2,200 3,050 $ 650 $ 650 $ 1,700 $ 3,750 $ 2,200 $ 8,950 56 [Table of Contents] We expect to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years. We will continue to examine all of our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures that will better align operating expenses with expected revenue levels and reallocate resources to better support growth initiatives. In addition, we have the flexibility to sell certain non strategic assets and implement other strategic initiatives, which may generate proceeds that would be available for debt repayment. As of December 31, 2006, our credit ratings were BBB from Fitch Ratings; Baa3 from Moodys Investor Service; and BBB from Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P). These credit ratings are investment grade. The Moodys and S&P ratings outlook is currently negative. Our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement requires that we maintain a ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2007 and 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter. The agreement also requires that we maintain a ratio of pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, to interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of these debt covenants. Exiting 2006, our ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA was 3.6 to 1.0 and the ratio of pro forma EBITDA to interest expense was 5.6 to 1.0. Any breach of these covenants would require that we obtain waivers from our lenders and there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. Our inability to obtain any necessary waivers, or to obtain them on reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Equity In March 2006, we filed a new public registration statement with the SEC. During the first quarter of 2006, we increased our authorized common stock from 1.2 billion shares to 2.0 billion shares in anticipation of our acquisition of Guidant, and issued approximately 577 million shares to former Guidant shareholders in conjunction with the acquisition. In April 2006, we issued approximately 65 million shares of our common stock under this registration statement to Abbott for $1.4 billion. See Note D Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details on the Guidant acquisition and Abbott transaction. During 2006, we received $145 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans as compared to $94 million in 2005. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during 2006. We repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million in 2005, and 10 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $360 million in 2004. Since 1992, we have repurchased approximately 132 million shares of our common stock and we have approximately 12 million shares of our common stock held in treasury at year end. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table. See Note D Business Combinations, Note F Borrowings and Credit Arrangements and Note H Leases to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information 57 [Table of Contents] regarding our business combinations, debt obligations and lease arrangements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our consolidated balance sheets do not reflect the obligations below that relate to expenses incurred in future periods. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 61 $ 47 $ 24 $ 11 $ 5 $ 36 $ 184 Purchase obligations 182 1 1 1 185 Minimum royalty obligations 3 3 3 1 1 6 17 Interest payments 521 497 457 371 214 1,013 3,073 $ 767 $ 548 $ 485 $ 384 $ 220 $ 1,055 $ 3,459 These obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Interest payment amounts related to the $5.0 billion five year term loan are projected using market interest rates as of December 31, 2006. Future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. See Note D Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our business combinations. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or may require us to make payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments, we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $90 million, which primarily consisted of financial lines of credit provided by banks and collateral for workers compensation programs. We enter these letters of credit and bank guarantees in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2006, we have not drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. At this time, we do not believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters of credit and, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability in our financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Our letters of credit and bank guarantees were immaterial at December 31, 2005. Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note ASignificant Accounting Policies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure 58 [Table of Contents] of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different, estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue consists primarily of the sale of single use medical devices. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For all other transactions, we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers, provided there are no remaining substantive performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance. For multiple element arrangements, whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, we defer revenue on the undelivered elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings. We establish a reserve for sales returns when the initial product is sold. We base our estimate for sales returns upon contractual commitments and historical trends and recorded such amount as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventory Reserves We base our provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Business Combinations We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. 59 [Table of Contents] We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, purchased research and development charges, and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with our strategic alliances as purchased research and development. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in process projects stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following ranges of risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: 13 percent to 17 percent in 2006, 18 percent to 27 percent in 2005, and 18 percent to 27 percent in 2004. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Impairment of Intangible Assets We review our intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. In addition, we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets. To test for impairment, we calculate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. We test our March 31 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. 60 [Table of Contents] Investments in Strategic Alliances We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment. Factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include, but are not limited to: our level of representation on the Board of Directors; our participation in the investees policy making processes; transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business; interchange of managerial personnel; the investees financial or technological dependency on us; and our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholders. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments and notes receivable associated with these alliances. See Note A Significant Accounting Policies and Note C Investments in Strategic Alliances to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $2.201 billion at December 31, 2006 and $110 million at December 31, 2005. The liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe we will substantially recover these assets. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are $7.186 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.106 billion at December 31, 2005. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where 61 [Table of Contents] the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination. See Note I Income Taxes to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting. Legal, Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are substantially self insured with respect to general, product liability and securities claims and record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, loss for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $485 million at December 31, 2006 and $35 million at December 31, 2005. In connection with our acquisition of Guidant, the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings filed against us, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, significantly increased. The amounts accrued at December 31, 2006 represent primarily accrued legal defense costs related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase price. In connection with the acquisition of Guidant, we are still assessing certain assumed litigation and product liability claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the future. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We adopted Statement No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method and have not restated prior period results of operations and financial position to reflect the impact of stock based compensation expense under Statement No. 123(R). We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of our stock options. We value restricted stock awards and deferred stock units based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant. The following represents the assumptions used in calculating our stock based compensation expense that require significant judgment by management: Expected Volatility We have considered a number of factors in estimating volatility. For options granted prior to 2006, we used our historical volatility as a basis to estimate expected volatility in our valuation of stock options. We changed our method of estimating volatility upon the adoption of Statement No. 123(R). We now consider historical volatility, trends in volatility within our industry/peer group and implied volatility. Expected Term We estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and forfeiture data. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of our new option grants. 62 [Table of Contents] Estimated Forfeiture Rate We have applied, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, an annual forfeiture rate of eight percent to all unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2006, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period. We will reevaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares that vest. See Note L Stock Ownership Plans to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion regarding our adoption of Statement No. 123(R). New Accounting Standard In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition. We will record the cumulative effect of initially adopting Interpretation No. 48 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adjustment and present such adjustment separately. Only tax positions that we are more likely than not to realize at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of Interpretation No. 48. We are required to adopt Interpretation No. 48 effective for our first quarter of 2007. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Lawrence C. Best President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 63 [Table of Contents] Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2007 64 [Table of Contents] ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $3.413 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.593 billion at December 31, 2005. We recorded $71 million of other assets and $27 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to $176 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $112 million at December 31, 2006 and by $129 million at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $134 million at December 31, 2006 and $157 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk of interest rate changes either by converting floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings or fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in the notional amount is due to $2.0 billion of hedge contracts related to our $5.0 billion five year term loan, offset by our termination of $1.1 billion in hedge contracts related to certain of our existing senior notes. We recorded $11 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to $21 million of other assets and $7 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2005. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to a decrease of $74 million at December 31, 2005. A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to an increase of $80 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged interest payments related to the hedged term loan. At December 31, 2006, $5.886 billion, or 81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding net debt is at fixed interest rates.
