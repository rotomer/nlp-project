ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures. We accomplish this mission through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our acquisitions and alliances. The growth and success of our organization is dependent upon the shared values of our people. Our quality policy, applicable to all employees, is I improve the quality of patient care and all things Boston Scientific. This personal commitment connects our people with the vision and mission of Boston Scientific. Our managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an executive summary that outlines financial highlights of 2007 and identifies key trends that impacted operating results during the year. We supplement this summary with an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects. We follow this discussion with an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2007 as compared to 2006 and for 2006 as compared to 2005. We then provide an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, and the trends underlying these changes. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical accounting policies. On April 21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the $10 billion global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) market, enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential, and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition has established us as one of the worlds largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapies. As a result of the acquisition, we now manufacture a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including tachycardia (abnormally fast or chaotic heart rhythms), bradycardia (slow or irregular heart rhythms), and heart failure (the hearts inability to pump effectively). These devices include implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker systems. In addition, we acquired Guidants Cardiac Surgery business, which produces cardiac surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation, endoscopic vessel harvesting and clampless beating heart bypass surgery. We divested the Cardiac Surgery business in a separate transaction in 2008; see Strategic Initiatives within the Executive Summary that follows for more information on this and our other business divestitures. We also now share certain drug eluting technology with Abbott Laboratories, which gives us access to a second drug eluting stent program, and complements our TAXUS stent system program. See Note C Acquisitions to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details on the Guidant acquisition and Abbott transaction. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 include a full year of results of our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses that we acquired from Guidant. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 include the results of the CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses beginning on the date of acquisition. We have included supplemental pro forma financial information in Note C Acquisitions to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K, which gives effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of 2006 and 2005. 38 Executive Summary Financial Highlights and Trends Our net sales in 2007 increased to $8.357 billion from $7.821 billion in 2006, an increase of $536 million or 7 percent. Our reported net loss for 2007 was $495 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, on approximately 1.5 billion weighted average shares outstanding, as compared to a net loss for 2006 of $3.577 billion, or $2.81 per diluted share, on approximately 1.3 billion weighted average shares outstanding. Our reported results included acquisition , divestiture , litigation and restructuring related charges2 (after tax) of $1.092 billion, or $0.73 per diluted share in 2007, as compared to acquisition related charges (after tax) of $4.566 billion, or $3.58 per diluted share, in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities was $934 million in 2007 as compared to $1.845 billion in 2006. The increase in our net sales for 2007 was driven primarily by our 2006 acquisition of Guidant. Worldwide sales of our CRM business increased to $2.124 billion from $1.371 billion in 2006, an increase of $753 million or 55 percent, on an as reported basis. On a pro forma basis, including the acquired CRM business for the entire year in 2006, CRM revenue increased $98 million, or five percent. The increase was a result of growth in the size of the worldwide markets for both ICD and pacemaker systems. We estimate that the size of the combined worldwide CRM market increased six percent in 2007, as compared to 2006. Partially offsetting increases in sales of our CRM products was a decrease in our coronary stent system sales. Worldwide sales of our coronary stent systems in 2007 were $2.027 billion, as compared to $2.506 billion in 2006, a decrease of $479 million or 19 percent. The deterioration was driven by decreases in sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems, attributable primarily to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size. Uncertainty regarding the perceived risk of late stent thrombosis3 following the use of drug eluting stents has resulted in lower procedural volumes and contributed to the overall decline. During 2007, we successfully launched our TAXUS Express2 drug eluting coronary stent system in Japan, and have achieved a leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market. During 2007, worldwide sales from our Endosurgery businesses increased to $1.479 billion from $1.346 billion in 2006, an increase of 10 percent. Further, our Neuromodulation business generated $317 million in net sales during 2007, as compared to $234 million in 2006, an increase of 36 percent. At December 31, 2007, we had total debt of $8.189 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $1.452 billion and working capital of $2.671 billion. During 2007, we prepaid $750 million of debt and prepaid an additional $200 million in January 2008. We expect to make a further payment of $425 million before the end of the first quarter of 2008 and expect to continue to use a significant portion of our future operating cash flows over the next several years to reduce our debt obligations. Strategic Initiatives In 2007, we announced several new initiatives designed to enhance short and long term shareholder value, 2 In 2007, these charges (after tax) include: a $553 million charge associated with the write down of goodwill in connection with business divestitures; a $294 million charge associated with on going patent litigation; $131 million of restructuring related charges associated with our expense and head count reduction initiatives; an $84 million charge for in process research and development costs; and $30 million in charges related to our 2006 acquisition of Guidant. In 2006, these charges included: $4.477 billion in purchase price adjustments related to Guidant, associated primarily with a $4.169 billion charge for in process research and development costs and a $169 million charge for the step up value of Guidant inventory sold; $143 million in other costs related primarily to the Guidant acquisition; and a $54 million credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) program that we obtained as part of our acquisition of TriVascular, Inc. 3 Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. 39 including the restructuring of several of our businesses and the sale of five non strategic businesses, as well as significant expense and head count reductions. Our goal is to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make needed investments in quality, research and development (R&D), capital and our people that are essential to our long term success. We expect these initiatives to help provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities, which will strengthen Boston Scientific for the future and position us for increased, sustainable and profitable sales growth. Our plan is to reduce R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by $475 million to $525 million against a $4.1 billion baseline, which represented our estimated annual R&D and SG&A expenses at the time we committed to these initiatives in 2007. This range represents the annualized run rate amount of reductions we expect to achieve as we exit 2008, as the implementation of these initiatives will take place throughout the year; however, we expect to realize the majority of these savings in 2008. In addition, we expect to reduce our R&D and SG&A expenses by an additional $25 million to $50 million in 2009. Restructuring In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved an expense and head count reduction plan, which we expect will result in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We are providing affected employees with severance packages, outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. The plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as a part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007 and expect to complete substantially all of these activities worldwide by the end of 2008. As of December 31, 2007, we had completed more than half of the anticipated head count reductions. The plan also provides for the restructuring of several businesses and product franchises in order to leverage resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model. We expect that the execution of this plan will result in total costs of approximately $425 million to $450 million. We recorded $205 million of these costs in the fourth quarter of 2007, and expect to record the remainder throughout 2008 and into 2009. We are recording these costs primarily as restructuring charges, with a portion recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Results of Operations and Note G Restructuring to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on these initiatives. Divestitures During 2007, we determined that our Auditory, Vascular Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Venous Access and Fluid Management businesses were no longer strategic to our ongoing operations. Therefore, we initiated the process of selling these businesses in 2007, and completed the sale of these businesses in 2008, as discussed below. We received gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion from these divestitures, and estimate future tax payments of approximately $350 million associated with these transactions. The combined 2007 revenues generated from these businesses was $553 million, or seven percent of our net sales. Approximately 2,000 positions were eliminated in connection with our business divestitures. In January 2008, we completed the sale of a controlling interest in our Auditory business and drug pump development program to entities affiliated with the principal former shareholders of Advanced Bionics Corporation for an aggregate payment of $150 million. In connection with the sale, we recorded a loss of $367 million (pre tax) in 2007, attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill. In January 2008, we completed the sale of our Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery businesses for $750 million in cash. In connection with the sale, we recorded a loss of $193 million (pre tax) in 2007, attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill. In addition, we expect to record a tax expense of approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2008 in connection with the closing of the transaction. In February 2008, we completed the sale of our Fluid Management business and our Venous Access franchise, previously part of our Oncology business, for $425 million in cash. We expect to record a pre tax gain of approximately $230 million during the first quarter of 2008 associated with this transaction. 40 Refer to Note E Assets Held for Sale to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding these transactions. In March 2007, we announced our intent to explore the benefits that could be gained from operating our Endosurgery group as a separately traded public company that would become a majority owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific. In July 2007, we completed our exploration of an IPO of a minority interest in our Endosurgery group and determined that the group will remain wholly owned by Boston Scientific. Monetization of Investments During the second quarter of 2007, we announced our decision to monetize the majority of our investment portfolio in order to eliminate investments determined to be non strategic. Following this decision, in 2007, we monetized several of our investments in, and notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies. We received total gross proceeds of $243 million in 2007 from the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable. We intend to monetize the rest of our non strategic portfolio investments over the next several quarters. The total carrying value of our portfolio of equity investments and notes receivable was $378 million as of December 31, 2007. We believe that the fair value of our individual investments and notes receivable equals or exceeds their carrying values as of December 31, 2007; however, we could recognize losses as we monetize these investments depending on the market conditions for these investments at the time of sale and the net proceeds we ultimately receive. Refer to our Other, net discussion and Note F Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on our investment portfolio and activity. FDA Warning Letters In December 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. In April 2007, following FDA reinspections of our CRM facilities, we resolved the warning letter and all associated restrictions were removed. In January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. In order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls, we launched Project Horizon, which has resulted in significant incremental spending on and the reallocation of internal employee and management resources to quality initiatives. It has also resulted in adjustments to the launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. We believe we have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and continue to make progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. We engaged a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate wide compliance prior to reinspection by the FDA. We completed substantially all of these third party audits during 2007 and, in February 2008, the FDA commenced its reinspection of certain of our facilities. We believe that these reinspections represent a critical step toward the resolution of the corporate warning letter. In addition, in August 2007, we received a warning letter from the FDA regarding the conduct of clinical investigations associated with our TriVascular AAA program. We are taking corrective action and have made certain commitments to the FDA regarding the conduct of our clinical trials. We terminated the TriVascular AAA program in 2006 and do not believe this warning letter will have an impact on the timing of the resolution of our corporate warning letter. There can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these quality issues to our satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the FDA. Our inability to resolve these quality issues in a timely 41 manner may further delay product launch schedules, including the anticipated U.S. launch of our next generation drug eluting stent system, the TAXUS Libert, which may weaken our competitive position in the market. If our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may need to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions. Outlook Coronary Stent Business Coronary stent revenue represented approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2007, as compared to 32 percent in 2006, as a result of our acquisition of Guidant, which significantly expanded our product offerings, as well as a decline in our coronary stent system sales in 2007. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0 billion in 2007, as compared to approximately $6.0 billion in 2006, and estimate that drug eluting stents represented approximately 80 percent of the dollar value of worldwide coronary stent market sales in 2007, as compared to 90 percent in 2006. Coronary stent market size is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed; the number of devices used per procedure; average drug eluting stent selling prices; and the drug eluting stent penetration rate (a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures). Uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug eluting stents, as well as the increased perceived risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents, has contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size. However, recent data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug eluting stent systems could positively affect the size of the drug eluting stent market, as referring cardiologists regain confidence in this technology. In October 2006, we received CE mark approval to begin marketing our PROMUS everolimus eluting coronary stent system, which is a private labeled XIENCE V drug eluting stent system supplied to us by Abbott. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the profit margin of a PROMUS stent system is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS stent system. Therefore, an increase in PROMUS stent system revenue relative to our total drug eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our profit margins. We will incur incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize additional products utilizing everolimus eluting stent technology and to support an internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent system in the future. We expect that this stent system will have profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS stent system. See the Purchased Research and Development section for further discussion. In June 2007, Abbott submitted the final module of a pre market approval (PMA) application to the FDA seeking approval in the U.S. for both the XIENCE V and PROMUS stent systems. In November 2007, the FDA advisory panel reviewing Abbotts PMA submission voted to recommend the stent systems for approval. Following FDA approval, which Abbott is expecting in the first half of 2008, we plan to launch the PROMUS stent system in the U.S. The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total Drug eluting $ 1,006 $ 782 $ 1,788 $ 1,561 $ 797 $ 2,358 Bare metal 104 135 239 52 96 148 $ 1,110 $ 917 $ 2,027 $ 1,613 $ 893 $ 2,506 During 2007, sales of our TAXUS stent system in the U.S. declined $555 million or 36 percent, as compared to the prior year, due to a decline in market size. Decreases in drug eluting stent penetration rates, as well as 42 decreases in PCI procedural volume contributed to an overall reduction in the U.S. coronary stent market size. Drug eluting stent penetration rates were 62 percent exiting 2007, as compared to 73 percent exiting 2006. Penetration rates decreased throughout 2007, but appear to have stabilized at approximately 62 percent during the fourth quarter of 2007, which was largely consistent with the third quarter average penetration rate of 63 percent. We estimate that the number of PCI procedures performed in the U.S. in 2007 decreased eight percent, as compared to 2006. Despite the decrease in the size of the U.S. drug eluting stent market, we remain the market leader with 55 percent market share for 2007. However, we expect that there will be increased pressure on our U.S. drug eluting stent system sales due to new competitive launches. Until February 2008, the TAXUS stent system was one of only two drug eluting stent products in the U.S. market. In February, however, an additional competitor entered the U.S. drug eluting stent market. Our share of this market, as well as unit prices, are expected to be negatively impacted as additional competitors enter the U.S. drug eluting stent market, including Abbotts anticipated launch of XIENCE V in the first half of 2008. During 2007, our international drug eluting stent system net sales decreased $15 million, or two percent, as compared to 2006, due primarily to an overall decline in the size of the international drug eluting stent market. Sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our Europe and Inter Continental markets were negatively impacted by declines in market size as a result of decreases in drug eluting stent penetration rates and decreased PCI procedural volume, as compared to 2006, driven primarily by continued concerns regarding safety and efficacy. This decline was offset partially by the successful launch of our TAXUS Express2 drug eluting coronary stent system in Japan in May 2007. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the markets perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. In addition, the FDA has informed stent manufacturers of new requirements for clinical trial data for PMA applications and post market surveillance studies for drug eluting stent products, which could affect our new product launch schedules and increase the cost of product approval and compliance. We believe that we can maintain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including: the broad and consistent long term results of our TAXUS clinical trials, including up to five years of clinical follow up; the performance benefits of our current and future technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products, including opportunities to expand indications for use through FDA review of existing and additional randomized trial data in extended use subsets; our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and our two drug eluting stent platform strategy, including our TAXUS paclitaxel eluting and our PROMUS everolimus eluting coronary stent systems. However, a further decline in revenues from our drug eluting stent systems could continue to have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include: 43 the entry of additional competitors into the market, including the recent approval of a competitive product in the U.S.; physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug eluting stents, including expected abatement of prior concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis; drug eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of PCI procedures performed, average number of stents used per procedure, and declines in average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems; variations in clinical results or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; the outcomes of intellectual property litigation; our ability to launch next generation products and technology features, including our TAXUS Libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system and our PROMUS everolimus eluting coronary stent system, in the U.S. market; our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel; and changes in FDA clinical trial data and post market surveillance requirements and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance. CRM Business CRM revenue represented approximately 25 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2007, as compared to approximately 18 percent in 2006, or 24 percent on a pro forma basis, including the CRM business for the entire year in 2006. We estimate that the worldwide CRM market approximated $10.0 billion in 2007, as compared to approximately $9.5 billion in 2006, and estimate that U.S. ICD system sales represented approximately 40 percent of the worldwide CRM market in 2007, as it did in 2006. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM sales: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total ICD systems $ 1,053 $ 489 $ 1,542 $ 1,053 $ 420 $ 1,473 Pacemaker systems 318 264 582 305 248 553 $ 1,371 $ 753 $ 2,124 $ 1,358 $ 668 $ 2,026 Less: Jan 1 Apr 20 net sales 655 CRM sales, as reported $ 1,371 On a pro forma basis, our U.S. sales of ICD systems for 2007 remained flat with 2006, with both the market size and our share of the market substantially unchanged. Our international ICD system sales increased 16 percent in 2007, as compared to 2006, on a pro forma basis, due primarily to an increase in market size. We also experienced year over year growth, on a pro forma basis, in pacemaker system sales in both the U.S. and 44 international markets. However, a field action initiated in 2007 by one of our competitors may have an adverse impact on the overall size of the CRM market. In addition, our net sales and market share in Japan were negatively impacted by a decision made in 2007 by our CRM distributor in that country to no longer distribute our CRM products. As a result, we are currently moving to a direct sales model in Japan and, until we fully implement this model, our net sales and market share in Japan may be negatively impacted. Worldwide CRM market growth rates in 2007 and 2006, including the U.S. ICD market, were below those experienced in prior years, resulting primarily from previous field actions in the industry and from a lack of new indications for use. While we expect that growth rates in the worldwide CRM market will improve over time, there can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical growth rates or that we will be able to increase net sales in a timely manner, if at all. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and our position within that market include: our ability to launch next generation products and technology features in a timely manner; our ability to re establish the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in our technology; future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; successful conclusion and positive outcomes of on going clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use; variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel; new competitive launches; declines in average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed; and the outcome of legal proceedings related to our CRM business. In April 2007, following FDA reinspections of our CRM facilities, we resolved the warning letter issued to Guidant in December 2005 and all associated restrictions were removed. We believe the FDAs decision is a crucial element in our ongoing efforts to rebuild trust and restore confidence in our CRM product offerings, and has allowed us to resume our new product cadence. Following the resolution of the warning letter, we received various FDA approvals that had been pending and have since launched several new CRM products. Intellectual Property Litigation There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our existing competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the coronary stent market. See Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of these legal proceedings. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain 45 externally through acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development program is focused largely on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. We now have access to a second drug eluting stent program, which complements our existing TAXUS stent system program. We expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug eluting stent program, along with our internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent program, to continue to sustain our leadership position in the worldwide drug eluting stent market. During 2008, we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and development expenses as a result of our two drug eluting stent programs. We successfully launched our next generation drug eluting stent product, the TAXUS Libert stent system, during 2005 in our Europe and Inter Continental markets, and expect to launch the product in the U.S. in the second half of 2008, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our CRM technologies, including our LATITUDE Patient Management System, a technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients remain in their homes. In October 2006, the FDA approved expansion of our LATITUDE system to be used for remote monitoring in certain existing ICD systems and cardiac resynchronization defibrillator (CRT D) systems. In addition, we will continue to invest in our next generation pulse generator platform acquired with Guidant. We recently received CE Mark approval for our next generation COGNIS CRT D and TELIGEN ICD devices utilizing this technology and expect to launch these products in the U.S. in the second half of 2008, subject to regulatory approval. We also expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug eluting stent and CRM technologies. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth. Our acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have alliances or options to purchase, or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these acquisitions and other alliances, we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic growth initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects. We have entered a significant number of alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and some give us the option to acquire the other company or its assets in the future. We enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. During 2007, we began the process of monetizing certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic (see the Strategic Initiatives section). While we believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth, the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. While we believe that the size of drug eluting stent and CRM markets will increase above existing levels, there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of this recovery. In 2008, we will continue to examine and, if necessary, reprioritize our internal research and development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio based on expectations of future market growth. This reprioritization may result in our decision to sell, discontinue, write down, or otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects, operations, investments or assets. Any proceeds from sales, or any increases in operating cash flows, resulting from these reprioritization activities may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested in other research and development projects or other operational initiatives. 46 Reimbursement and Funding Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and often conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. There is no way of predicting the outcome of these reimbursement decisions, nor their impact on our operating results. International Markets International markets, including Japan, are also affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are under way in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as Japan, Europe and other international markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products and may influence a physicians selection of products used to treat patients. We expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. Further, some emerging markets rely on the FDAs Certificate for Foreign government (CFG) in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements. Our FDA corporate warning letter prevents our ability to obtain CFGs; therefore, our ability to market new products or renew marketing approvals in countries that rely on CFGs will continue to be impacted until the corporate warning letter is resolved. Our limited ability to market our full line of existing products and to launch new products within these jurisdictions could have a material adverse impact on our business.

The relative change on a constant currency basis by division approximated the change on an as reported basis. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note P Segment Reporting to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Growth rates are based on actual, non rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. U.S. Net Sales In 2007, our U.S. net sales increased $83 million, or two percent, as compared to 2006. The increase related primarily to increases in U.S. CRM and Cardiac Surgery business sales of $502 million due to a full year of consolidated operations in 2007, whereas the results for these businesses were included only following the April 21, 2006 acquisition date in 2006. In addition, we achieved year over year U.S. sales growth of $64 million in our Endosurgery businesses and $65 million in our Neuromodulation business. Offsetting these increases was a decline in U.S. net sales of our TAXUS drug eluting stent system of $555 million, due primarily to a decrease in the size of the U.S. drug eluting stent market. This decrease was driven principally by continued declines in drug eluting stent penetration rates resulting from ongoing concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of drug eluting stents. Our U.S. drug eluting stent market share was stable during both 48 2007 and 2006; we maintained continuous market share of at least 53 percent throughout those periods. See the Outlook section for a more detailed discussion of both the drug eluting stent and CRM markets and our position within those markets. In 2006, our U.S. net sales increased $988 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase is related primarily to the inclusion of $1.025 billion of U.S. net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses acquired in April 2006. In addition, we achieved year over year U.S. sales growth of $83 million in our Endosurgery businesses and $75 million in our Neuromodulation business. Offsetting these increases were declines in U.S. net sales of our TAXUS drug eluting stent system of $202 million, due principally to a decrease in the size of the U.S. drug eluting stent market, and a decline in our average market share in 2006, as compared to 2005. In addition, decreases in net sales of approximately $70 million were attributable to the first quarter 2006 expiration of our agreement to distribute certain third party guidewire and sheath products. International Net Sales In 2007, our international net sales increased $453 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 2006. The increase related partially to an increase in net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses of $210 million, due to a full year of consolidated results in 2007, and $85 million associated with increased sales of both ICD and pacemaker systems. In addition, net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our Asia Pacific region increased $131 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, due primarily to the May 2007 launch of our TAXUS Express2 coronary stent system in Japan. The favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations also contributed $180 million to our sales growth in 2007. Offsetting these increases were declines in net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our Europe and Inter Continental markets by $145 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, due primarily to an overall decline in the size of the drug eluting stent market as well as market share declines in these regions, as additional competitive products entered the market. See the Outlook section for a more detailed discussion of both the drug eluting stent and CRM markets and our position within those markets. In 2006, our international net sales increased by $550 million, or 23 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase related primarily to the inclusion of $478 million of international net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses acquired in April 2006. The remainder of the increase in our net sales in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $35 million in net sales from our Endosurgery businesses, as well as $27 million of sales growth from our Neurovascular business. Gross Profit In 2007, our gross profit was $6.015 billion, as compared to $5.614 billion in 2006, an increase of $401 million or seven percent. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased slightly to 72.0 percent for 2007, as compared to 71.8 percent for 2006. For 2006, our gross profit was $5.614 billion, as compared to $4.897 billion for 2005. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 71.8 percent for 2006, as compared to 77.9 percent for 2005. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit percentages from 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Gross profit prior year 71.8 % 77.9 % Inventory step up charge in 2006 3.4 % (3.8 )% Shifts in product mix (1.8 )% (0.8 )% Impact of lower production volumes (0.8 )% Impact of period expenses (0.8 )% (2.0 )% All other 0.2 % 0.5 % Gross profit current year 72.0 % 71.8 % 49 Included in cost of products sold for 2006 was an adjustment of $267 million, representing the step up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold during the year. There were no amounts included in our 2007 cost of products sold related to the inventory step up and, as of December 31, 2007, we had no step up value remaining in inventory. Factors contributing to a shift in our product sales mix toward lower margin products in 2007 included a decrease in sales of our higher margin TAXUS drug eluting stent system and an increase in sales of our CRM products, which generally have lower gross profit margins. In addition, we have manufactured lower volumes of certain of our products, including our drug eluting stent systems, which has resulted in higher unit costs during 2007. Our period expenses included, among other items, increased charges for scrapped inventory in 2007 as compared to 2006. Included in cost of products sold for 2006 was the $267 million inventory step up adjustment discussed above, whereas there were no such amounts included in our 2005 cost of products sold. In addition, increases in period expenses, including costs associated with Project Horizon, contributed to a decline in our gross profit percentage for 2006, as compared to 2005. Further, our 2006 gross profit percentage was negatively impacted as compared to 2005 due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including a decrease in sales of our TAXUS drug eluting stent system and an increase in sales of our CRM products. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development, restructuring charges, litigation related charges and losses on assets held for sale: 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,909 34.8 2,675 34.2 1,814 28.9 Research and development expenses 1,091 13.1 1,008 12.9 680 10.8 Royalty expense 202 2.4 231 3.0 227 3.6 Amortization expense 641 7.7 530 6.8 152 2.4 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2007, our SG&A expenses increased by $234 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2006. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased slightly to 34.8 percent in 2007 from 34.2 percent in 2006. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to: $266 million in incremental SG&A expenditures associated with a full year of consolidated CRM and Cardiac Surgery operations, offset partially by decreases in spending attributable to planned expense reductions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section for more discussion of these expense reduction initiatives. In 2006, our SG&A expenses increased by $861 million, or 47 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 34.2 percent in 2006 from 28.9 percent in 2005. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to: $670 million in expenditures associated with CRM and Cardiac Surgery; $65 million of acquisition related costs associated primarily with certain Guidant integration and retention programs; $63 million due primarily to increased head count attributable to the expansion of our sales force within our international regions and Neuromodulation business; and $55 million in incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Refer to Note N Stock Ownership Plans to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a more detailed discussion of our adoption of Statement No. 123(R). Research and Development (R&D) Expenses Our investment in R&D reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2007, our R&D expenses increased by $83 million, or 8 percent, as 50 compared to 2006. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased marginally to 13.1 percent in 2007 from 12.9 percent in 2006. The increase related primarily to $142 million in incremental R&D expenditures associated with a full year of consolidated CRM and Cardiac Surgery operations, offset partially by lower spending of approximately $37 million associated with the cancellation of our Endovations single use endoscope R&D program. During the second quarter of 2007, we determined that our Endovations system would not be a commercially viable product and terminated the program. In addition, our 2006 R&D expenses included approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA stent graft program. See the Purchased Research and Development section for further discussion regarding the cancellation of this program. We do not expect these program cancellations to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. In 2006, our R&D expenses increased by $328 million, or 48 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased to 12.9 percent in 2006 from 10.8 percent in 2005. The increase related primarily to: the inclusion of $270 million in R&D expenditures associated with our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses; approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $24 million of stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R); and $13 million of acquisition related costs associated with certain Guidant integration and retention programs. Royalty Expense In 2007, our royalty expense decreased by $29 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2006, due primarily to lower sales of our TAXUS drug eluting stent system. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense decreased to 2.4 percent from 3.0 percent for 2006, due to shifts in our sales mix toward products with lower royalties. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system decreased $48 million as compared to 2006, due to a decrease in TAXUS stent system sales. Offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense attributable to CRM and Cardiac Surgery products of $13 million, due to a full year of consolidated results. In 2006, our royalty expense increased by $4 million, or two percent, as compared to 2005. The increase was due to $25 million of royalty expense associated with CRM and Cardiac Surgery products. This increase was offset partially by a decrease in royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system by $20 million for 2006 as compared to 2005, due primarily to a decrease in TAXUS stent system sales. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense decreased to 3.0 percent in 2006 from 3.6 percent in 2005, due primarily to the inclusion of net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery products, which on average have a lower royalty cost relative to legacy Boston Scientific products. Amortization Expense In 2007, our amortization expense increased by $111 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2006. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 7.7 percent in 2007 from 6.8 percent in 2006. The increase in our amortization expense related primarily to $147 million of incremental amortization associated with intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition, due to a full year of amortization. In addition, amortization expense included $21 million attributable to the write off of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies (AST), due to our decision to suspend further significant funding of R&D with respect to the Petal bifurcation stent. We do not expect this decision to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. These increases were offset by the inclusion in 2006 of the write off of intangible assets of: $23 million attributable to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program, $21 million associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005 acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation, and $12 million associated with our Real time Position Management System (RPM) technology. In 2006, our amortization expense increased by $378 million, or 249 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 6.8 percent in 2006 from 2.4 percent in 2005. 51 The increase in our amortization expense related primarily to: $334 million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition; $23 million for the write off of intangible assets due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $21 million for the write off of the intangible assets associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005 acquisition of Rubicon; and $12 million for the write off of the intangible assets associated with our RPM technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as part of our acquisition of Cardiac Pathways Corporation. The write off of the RPM intangible assets resulted from our decision to cease investment in the technology. The write off of the Rubicon developed technology resulted from our decision to cease development of the first generation of the technology and concentrate resources on the development and commercialization of the next generation product. Purchased Research and Development In 2007, we recorded $85 million of purchased research and development, including $75 million associated with our acquisition of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc., $13 million resulting from the application of equity method accounting for one of our strategic investments, and $12 million associated with payments made for certain early stage CRM technologies. Additionally, in June 2007, we terminated our product development agreement with Aspect Medical Systems relating to brain monitoring technology that Aspect has been developing to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimers disease and other neurological conditions. As a result, we recognized a credit to purchased research and development of approximately $15 million during 2007, representing future payments that we would have been obligated to make prior to the termination of the agreement. We do not expect the termination of the agreement to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. The $75 million of in process research and development acquired with Remon consists of a pressure sensing system development project, which will be combined with our existing CRM devices. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that the total cost to complete the development project is between $75 million and $80 million. We expect to launch devices using pressure sensing technology in 2013 in Europe and certain other international countries, and in the U.S. in 2016, subject to regulatory approval. We expect material net cash inflows from such products to commence in 2016, following the launch of this technology in the U.S. In 2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development, including a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with the in process research and development obtained in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition; a credit of $67 million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of $17 million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment in EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc. The $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the Guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired CRM related products and $540 million for drug eluting stent technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes $369 million representing the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon its receipt of regulatory approvals for certain products. We recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals, and the asset had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. We will recognize the milestone payments, if received, as a gain in our financial statements at the time of receipt. The most significant purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant include the next generation CRM pulse generator platform and rights to the everolimus eluting stent technology that we share with Abbott. The next generation pulse generator platform incorporates new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing know how and institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this platform across all CRM product families, including ICD systems, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices and pacemaker systems, to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart. The next generation products using this platform include the COGNIS CRT D 52 device, the TELIGEN ICD device and the INGENIO pacemaker system. During the first quarter of 2008, we received CE Mark approval for our COGNIS CRT D device, which includes defibrillation capability, and the TELIGEN ICD device, and expect a full European launch by the end of the second quarter of 2008. We expect a U.S. launch of the COGNIS and TELIGEN devices in the second half of 2008, following regulatory approval. We expect to launch the INGENIO device in both Europe and the U.S. in the second half of 2010. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that the total cost to complete the COGNIS and TELIGEN technology is between $25 million and $35 million, and the cost to complete the INGENIO technology is between $30 million and $35 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the COGNIS and TELIGEN devices to commence in the second half of 2008 and material net cash inflows from the INGENIO device to commence in the second half of 2010. The $540 million attributable to everolimus eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to Guidants everolimus based drug eluting stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched the PROMUS everolimus eluting coronary stent system, which is a private labeled XIENCE V drug eluting stent system supplied to us by Abbott, in certain European countries. In 2007, we expanded our launch in Europe, as well as in key countries in other regions. In June 2007, Abbott submitted the final module of a pre market approval (PMA) application to the FDA seeking approval in the U.S. for both the XIENCE V and PROMUS stent systems. In November 2007, the FDA advisory panel reviewing Abbotts PMA submission voted to recommend the stent systems for approval. Following FDA approval, which Abbott is expecting in the first half of 2008, we plan to launch the PROMUS stent system in the U.S. We expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured next generation everolimus based stent in Europe in late 2009 or early 2010 and in the U.S. in late 2012 or early 2013. We expect that material net cash inflows from our internally developed and manufactured everolimus based drug eluting stent will commence in 2013, following its approval in the U.S. As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that the cost to complete our internally manufactured next generation everolimus eluting stent technology project is between $200 million and $250 million. In 2005, we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development consisting of $130 million relating to our acquisition of TriVascular, $73 million relating to our acquisition of AST, $45 million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon, and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development in conjunction with entering the product development agreement with Aspect. The most significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included TriVasculars AAA stent graft and ASTs Petal bifurcation stent, which collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 purchased research and development. During 2006, management cancelled the TriVascular AAA stent graft program. In addition, in connection with our expense and head count reduction plan, in 2007, we decided to suspend further significant funding of research and development associated with the Petal stent project and may or may not decide to pursue its completion. We do not expect these program cancellations and related write downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. In connection with the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program, we recorded $67 million credit to purchased research and development in 2006, representing the reversal of our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting. Restructuring In 2007, we recorded $176 million of restructuring charges. In addition, we recorded $29 million of expenses within other lines of our consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives. In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan, which will result in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We are providing affected employees with severance packages, outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. As of December 31, 2007, we had completed more than half of the anticipated head count reductions. The plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses and product franchises in order to leverage resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of 53 spending on certain R&D projects; and the transfer of certain production lines from one facility to another. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of 2007 and expect to be substantially completed worldwide by the end of 2008. We expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre tax expenses of approximately $425 million to $450 million. We expect the plan to result in cash outlays of approximately $400 million to $425 million. The following table provides a summary of our estimates of total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of cost Total amount expected to be incurred Termination benefits $260 million to $270 million Retention incentives $60 million to $65 million Asset write offs and accelerated depreciation $45 million to $50 million Other * $60 million to $65 million * Other costs consist primarily of costs to transfer product lines from one facility to another and consultant fees. In 2007, we incurred total restructuring costs of $205 million. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our consolidated statements of operations: Termination Benefits Retention Incentives Intangible Asset Write offs Fixed Asset Write offs Accelerated Depreciation Other Total Cost of goods sold $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 Selling, general and adminstrative expenses 2 2 4 Research and development expenses 2 2 Amortization expense $ 21 21 Restructuring charges $ 158 $ 8 $ 10 176 $ 158 $ 5 $ 21 $ 8 $ 3 $ 10 $ 205 The termination benefits recorded during 2007 represent primarily amounts incurred pursuant to our on going benefit arrangements, and have been recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. We expect to record the remaining termination benefits in 2008 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. The asset write offs relate to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment that are not recoverable following our decision in October 2007 to (i) commit to the expense and head count reduction plan, including the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain R&D projects, and (ii) restructure several businesses. The retention incentives represent cash incentives, which are being recorded over the future service period during which eligible employees must remain employed with us to retain the award. The other restructuring costs are being recognized and measured at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. We made approximately $40 million of cash outlays associated with our restructuring initiatives in 2007, which related to termination benefits, other restructuring charges and retention incentive payments. These payments were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to make the remaining cash outlays throughout 2008 and into 2009 using cash generated from operations. As a result of our restructuring initiatives, we expect to reduce R&D and SG&A expenses by $475 million to $525 million against a $4.1 billion baseline, which represents our estimated annual R&D and SG&A expenses 54 at the time we committed to these initiatives in 2007. This range represented the annualized run rate amount of reductions we expect to achieve as we exit 2008, as the implementation of these initiatives will take place throughout the year; however, we expect to realize the majority of these savings in 2008. In addition, we expect to reduce our R&D and SG&A expenses by an additional $25 million to $50 million in 2009. Refer to Note G Restructuring Activities to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on our restructuring plan. Litigation Related Charges In 2007, we recorded a $365 million pre tax charge associated with on going patent litigation involving our Interventional Cardiology business. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In 2005, we recorded a $780 million pre tax charge associated with a litigation settlement with Medinol, Ltd. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in Medinol. Loss on Assets Held for Sale During 2007, we recorded a $560 million loss attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill in connection with the sale of certain of our businesses. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section and Note E Assets Held for Sale to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on these transactions. Interest Expense Our interest expense increased to $570 million in 2007 as compared to $435 million in 2006. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels, as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average debt levels for 2007 increased compared to 2006 as a result of carrying a full year of incremental debt due to the acquisition of Guidant in April 2006. Higher debt levels in 2007 contributed incremental interest expense of $109 million. At December 31, 2007, $5.433 billion of our total debt was at fixed interest rates, representing 66 percent of our total debt or 81 percent of our net debt4 balance. Our interest expense increased to $435 million in 2006 from $90 million in 2005. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels used to finance the Guidant acquisition, as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate. Fair Value Adjustment We recorded net expense of $8 million in 2007 and $95 million in 2006 to reflect the change in fair value related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, which is discussed in further detail in Note C Acquisitions to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. This sharing of proceeds feature was marked to market through earnings based upon changes in our stock price, among other factors. There was no fair value associated with this feature as of December 31, 2007. Other, net Our other, net reflected income of $23 million in 2007, expense of $56 million in 2006, and income of 4 Our net debt balance represents our total debt less our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for more information. 55 $13 million in 2005. Our other, net included investment write downs of $124 million in 2007, $121 million in 2006, and $17 million in 2005, attributable primarily to other than temporary declines in the fair value of our equity investments in, and notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies. Our 2007 write downs related to impairments of multiple investments. Our 2006 write downs related primarily to a $34 million write down associated with an investment in a gene therapy company and a $27 million write down associated with one of our vascular sealing portfolio companies; the remainder of our 2006 write downs related to impairments of multiple investments. These write downs were offset partially by realized gains on investments of $65 million in 2007, $9 million in 2006, and $4 million in 2005. Refer to Note F Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding our investment portfolio. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $79 million in 2007, $67 million in 2006, and $36 million in 2005. Our interest income increased in 2007, as compared to 2006, due primarily to higher average cash balances, offset by lower average investment rates. Our interest income increased in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to increases in our cash and cash equivalents balances and increases in average market interest rates. Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Decrease 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 Reported tax rate (13.0 ) % 1.2 % 29.5 % (14.2 ) % (28.3 ) % Impact of certain charges (25.6 ) % (20.2 ) % 5.5 % (5.4 ) % (25.7 ) % In 2007, the decrease in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2006, related primarily to additional foreign tax credits, changes in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the impact of certain charges during 2007 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included legal and restructuring reserves, purchased research and development and goodwill write downs not deductible for tax purposes, as well as discrete items associated with resolution of various tax matters and changes in estimates for tax benefits claimed related to prior periods. In 2006, the decrease in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2005, related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2006 that were taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included purchased research and development, asset write downs, reversal of taxes associated with unremitted earnings and tax gains on the sale of intangible assets. Management currently estimates that our 2008 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 21 percent, due primarily to our intention to reinvest offshore substantially all of our offshore earnings, and based upon the anticipated retro active re enactment of the U.S. R&D tax credit for all of 2008. However, acquisitions or dispositions in 2008 and geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As a result of the implementation of Interpretation No. 48, we recognized a $126 million increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Approximately $26 million of this increase was reflected as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Substantially all of the remaining increase related to pre acquisition uncertain tax liabilities related to Guidant, which we recorded as an increase to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 93 7, Uncertainties Related to Income Taxes in a Purchase Business Combination. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 1997. Substantially all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for all years through 2001. 56 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance.

The decrease in operating cash flow in 2007, as 5 Management uses net debt to monitor and evaluate cash and debt levels and believes it is a measure that provides valuable information regarding our net financial position and interest rate exposure. Users of our financial statements should consider this non GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 6 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. In addition, management considers EBITDA as a component of the financial covenants included in our credit agreements. Users of our financial statements should consider this non GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included acquisition , divestiture , litigation and restructuring related charges (pre tax) of $1.231 billion in 2007 and $4.628 billion in 2006; see the Executive Summary section above for a description of these charges. Our 2005 EBITDA included acquisition , divestiture , litigation and restructuring related charges (pre tax) of $1.102 billion, related primarily to a litigation settlement with Medinol and purchased research and development. 57 compared to 2006, is attributable primarily to: approximately $400 million in tax payments made in the first quarter of 2007, associated principally with the gain on Guidants sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott; an increase in interest payments of $160 million due to higher average debt levels; a decrease in EBITDA, excluding acquisition , divestiture , litigation , and restructuring related charges, of approximately $150 million; and an increase in severance and other merger and restructuring related payments of approximately $100 million, including severance payments made in the first half of 2007 in conjunction with our acquisition and integration of Guidant. See Note C Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further details. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $363 million in 2007, as compared to $341 million in 2006, including $110 million associated with our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $450 million during 2008, which includes capital expenditures to upgrade further our quality systems and information systems infrastructure, to enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug eluting stent platform, and to support continuous growth in our business units. Our investing activities during 2007 included $136 million of cash payments for acquisitions of businesses, investments in publicly traded and privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights; as well as $248 million in contingent payments, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; offset partially by $243 million of gross proceeds from the monetization of several of our investments in, and notes receivable from, certain privately held and publicly traded companies. In January 2007, we completed our acquisition of 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc., a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. We issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million and approximately $10 million in cash, in addition to our previous investments of approximately $40 million, to acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex, and may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain performance related milestones. In August 2007, we completed our acquisition of 100 percent of the fully diluted equity of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc. Remon is a development stage company focused on creating communication technology for medical device applications. We paid approximately $70 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Remon, in addition to our previous investments of $3 million to acquire the remaining interests of Remon. We may also be required to make future payments contingent upon Remon achieving certain performance related milestones. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. During 2007, we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement and prepaid $1.0 billion outstanding under the term loan, using $750 million of cash on hand and $250 million in borrowings against a credit facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. There was $250 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 and none outstanding at December 31, 2006. There were no amounts outstanding under our separate $2.0 billion revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. In addition, in 2007, cash flows from financing activities included a $60 million contractual payment made to reimburse Abbott for a portion of its cost of borrowing $1.4 billion in 2006 to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Guidant. Refer to Note C Acquisitions to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding the Abbott transaction. We had total debt of $8.189 billion at December 31, 2007 at an average interest rate of 6.36 percent as compared to total debt of $8.902 billion at December 31, 2006 at an average interest rate of 6.03 percent. The 58 debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2007, is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 300 $ 1,700 $ 2,000 $ 4,000 Abbott loan 900 900 Senior notes 850 $ 2,200 3,050 Credit and security facility $ 250 250 $ 250 $ 300 $ 1,700 $ 3,750 $ 2,200 $ 8,200 In January 2008, following the closing of the sale of, and receipt of proceeds for, three of our businesses, we prepaid an additional $200 million of our term loan, reducing the scheduled maturity in April 2009. We expect to make a further payment of $425 million before the end of the first quarter of 2008. These prepayments will satisfy the remaining obligation due in April 2009 and reduce the 2010 maturity by $325 million. We expect to continue to use a significant portion of our future operating cash flow over the next several years to reduce our debt obligations. Our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants. Among other items, our 2007 amendment extends a step down in the maximum permitted ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as follows: From: To: 4.5 times to 3.5 times on March 31, 2008 4.5 times to 4.0 times on March 31, 2009, and 4.0 times to 3.5 times on September 30, 2009 The amendment also provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, of up to $300 million of restructuring charges incurred through June 30, 2009 and up to $500 million of litigation and settlement expenses incurred (net of any litigation or settlement income received) in any consecutive four fiscal quarters, not to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate, through June 30, 2009. Other than the amended exclusions from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, there was no change in our minimum required ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, to interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Exiting 2007, our ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA was approximately 3.6 to 1.0 and our ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense was approximately 4.0 to 1.0. Our inability to maintain these covenants could require that we seek to further renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. During 2007, our credit ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings were downgraded to BB+, and our credit rating from Moodys Investor Service was downgraded to Ba1. These ratings are below investment grade and the ratings outlook by all three rating agencies is currently negative. Credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost, but do not require the repayment of borrowings. These credit rating changes have not materially increased the cost of our existing borrowings. Equity On May 22, 2007, we extended an offer to our non director and non executive employees to exchange certain outstanding stock options for deferred stock units (DSUs). Stock options previously granted under our stock plans with an exercise price of $25 or more per share were exchangeable for a smaller number of DSUs, based on exchange ratios derived from the exercise prices of the surrendered options. On June 20, 2007, following the expiration of the offer, our employees exchanged approximately 6.6 million options for approximately 1.1 million DSUs, which were subject to additional vesting restrictions. We did not record incremental stock 59 based compensation expense as a result of these exchanges because the fair values of the options exchanged equaled the fair values of the DSUs issued. During 2007, we received $132 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $145 million in 2006. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during 2007 or 2006. We repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million in 2005. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2007. See Note C Acquisitions, Note H Borrowings and Credit Arrangements and Note J Leases to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding our acquisitions, debt obligations and lease arrangements. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 64 $ 49 $ 37 $ 24 $ 17 $ 49 $ 240 Capital leases 5 4 3 3 3 47 65 Purchase obligations, 105 5 2 112 Minimum royalty obligations 16 29 26 14 1 6 92 Unrecognized tax benefits 60 60 Interest payments, 462 441 365 213 133 880 2,494 $ 712 $ 528 $ 433 $ 254 $ 154 $ 982 $ 3,063 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. These obligations relate primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Interest payment amounts related to our term loan are projected using market interest rates as of December 31, 2007. Future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.284 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note K Income Taxes to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. See Note C Acquisitions to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, performance milestones will be reached, or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock. Payments due to the former shareholders of Advanced Bionics in connection 60 with our amended merger agreement are accrued as of December 31, 2007, and therefore, do not appear in the table above. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $110 million, as compared to approximately $90 million at December 31, 2006, which consisted primarily of financial lines of credit provided by banks and collateral for workers compensation programs. We enter these letters of credit and bank guarantees in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2007, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. At this time, we do not believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters of credit and, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note ASignificant Accounting Policies to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single use medical devices. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For all other transactions, we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to the customer, provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance. For multiple element arrangements, whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value, and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings; for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction 61 of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above. Inventory Provisions We base our provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales and production levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Business Combinations We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development, which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, purchased research and development charges, and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. Purchased Research and Development The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with our alliances as purchased research and development. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in process projects stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in process 62 projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following ranges of risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: 19 percent in 2007, 13 percent to 17 percent in 2006, and 18 percent to 27 percent in 2005. We believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Impairment of Intangible Assets We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. In addition, we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets. To test for impairment, we calculate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Goodwill Impairment Annually we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of the year as of April 1, the beginning of our second quarter, using financial information available at that time. We test our goodwill balances more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we utilize the two step approach prescribed under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. In 2007 and 2006, we identified our ten domestic divisions, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our three international operating segments as our reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. To derive the carrying value of our reporting units at the time of acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting units operations, and would be considered in determining fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our June 30 interim financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test. Investments in Publicly Traded and Privately Held Entities We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity requires judgment. We consider the guidance in APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, EITF Issue No. 03 16, Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies, and EITF Topic D 46, Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments, in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity. We regularly review our investments for impairment indicators. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investments carrying value and its fair value. 63 See Note A Significant Accounting Policies and Note F Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $1.605 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.201 billion at December 31, 2006. The liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development, investment write downs, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are $7.804 billion at December 31, 2007 and $7.186 billion at December 31, 2006. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination. See Note K Income Taxes to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting. Legal, Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are substantially self insured with respect to general and product liability claims. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We record losses for claims in excess of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of 64 defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $994 million at December 31, 2007 and $485 million at December 31, 2006. The amounts accrued represent primarily accrued amounts related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase price, as well as amounts associated with on going patent litigation involving our Interventional Cardiology business. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings. New Accounting Standards Standards Implemented Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. We adopted Interpretation No. 48 as of the first quarter of 2007. Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as enhanced disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition. Refer to Note K Income Taxes to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information regarding our application of Interpretation No. 48 and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which amends Statements Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Statement No. 158 requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the consolidated statements of financial position, as well as the recognition of certain gains and losses that arise during the period, but are deferred under pension accounting rules, in other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted Statement No. 158 in 2006. Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for more information on our pension and other postretirement plans. Issue No. 06 3 In June 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 063, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation). The scope of this consensus includes any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to: sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. Per Issue No. 06 3, the presentation of these taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed. We present sales net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. We adopted Issue No. 063 as of the first quarter of 2007. No change of presentation has resulted from our adoption. Statement No. 123(R) In December 2004, the FASB issued statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting 65 Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. We adopted Statement No. 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. Refer to Note N Stock Ownership Plans to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for discussion of our adoption of the standard and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. New Standards to be Implemented Statement No. 141(R) In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations, a replacement for Statement No. 141. The Statement retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141, but requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the acquisition date. It also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values. Additionally, Statement No. 141(R) supersedes FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) now requires that purchased research and development be recognized as an intangible asset. We are required to adopt Statement No. 141(R) prospectively for any acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009. Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. We are required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 157 prospectively as of January 1, 2008, and recognize any transition adjustment as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We are in the process of determining the effect of adoption of Statement No. 157, but we do not believe its adoption will materially impact our future results of operations or financial position. Statement No. 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which allows an entity to elect to record financial assets and liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition on a contract by contract basis. Subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as the changes occur. We will adopt Statement No. 159 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements, but we do not believe its adoption will materially impact our future results of operations or financial position. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Sam R. Leno James R. Tobin Sam R. Leno President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President Finance & Information Systems and Chief Financial Officer 66 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation: We have audited Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2008 67 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.135 billion at December 31, 2007 and $3.413 billion at December 31, 2006. We recorded $19 million of other assets and $118 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2007 as compared to $71 million of other assets and $27 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2006. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $293 million at December 31, 2007 and by $112 million at December 31, 2006. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $355 million at December 31, 2007 and by $134 million at December 31, 2006. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk of interest rate changes either by converting floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings or fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The notional amount decrease is due to quarterly hedge reductions of $250 million beginning in September 2007 and ending in June 2009. We recorded $17 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at December 31, 2007 as compared to $11 million at December 31, 2006. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $9 million at December 31, 2007, as compared to an increase of $26 million at December 31, 2006. A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $9 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to a decrease of $26 million at December 31, 2006. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged interest payments related to the hedged term loan. At December 31, 2007, $5.433 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing 66 percent of our total debt and 81 percent of our net debt balance. See Note I Financial Instruments to our 2007 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for detailed information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 68 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in notes K and Q to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As discussed in notes N and Q to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2008 69
